## Executive Summary

The Product Workplan bridges the gap between high-level organizational strategy and short-term product roadmaps. Too often, product leaders default to either abstract org strategy (not actionable) or tactical roadmaps (optimizes short-term at expense of long-term). The workplan provides the missing middle layer—translating strategic priorities into sequenced product work across multiple time periods.

Building an effective workplan requires four phases: identifying strategic priorities within your scope, brainstorming product work across all four types (Feature, Growth, PMF Expansion, Scaling), developing the workplan using impact/urgency sequencing, and communicating/iterating with leadership and teams. The key insight is that different audiences need different emphasis—leadership needs "how" (execution confidence), teams need "why" (alignment and context).

The Product Sequencing Matrix categorizes work into four buckets: Cornerstone (high impact, high urgency—do first), Non-Essential (low impact, low urgency—deprioritize), Important but Flexible (high impact, low urgency—prep and validate), and Supporting (low impact, high urgency—mitigate and queue). Great product leaders avoid firefighting by proactively investing in important-but-flexible and supporting work before it becomes urgent.

The bonus case studies (Slack, HubSpot, Match Group, Pinterest, Airbnb) demonstrate how successful companies sequence different types of product work over years-long horizons, showing that most success comes from a few key strategic initiatives rather than thousands of incremental improvements.

## 1. The Product Workplan Foundation

### Bridging Strategy and Roadmap

| Level | Scope | Problem When Overemphasized |
|-------|-------|---------------------------|
| Org Strategy | Company-wide direction | Too abstract, not actionable |
| **Product Workplan** | **Multi-period product work** | **The missing bridge** |
| Product Roadmap | Short-term tactical actions | Optimizes short-term at expense of long-term |

> "Too often when you're focusing on the short-term instead of long-term value, you can optimize your way straight into a strategic brick wall."
> — Casey Winters

**Pinterest Example**: The team became so efficient at driving signups they could project signing up every American. Signups ceased to be the key metric—they needed to focus on activation, potentially at the expense of signup growth.

### What Happens Without a Workplan

- **Short-term optimization** — Actions creating value now at expense of later
- **Working backwards to unmeasurable goals** — Lofty aspirations without path
- **Misaligned definitions of success** — Disconnect between you and leadership

### Two Purposes of the Product Workplan

1. **Build the roadmap** — High-level plan guides roadmapping process
2. **Communicate the roadmap** — Explains important decisions and trade-offs

> "Your product workplan is the framework you can use to inform your actual product roadmap."
> — Casey Winters

### Four Phases of Workplan Development

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1. Identify Strategic Priorities | Determine priorities within your scope | Strategic Priority Map |
| 2. Brainstorm Product Work | Ideate work supporting priorities | Ideation Board (4 types) |
| 3. Develop Product Workplan | Categorize and sequence by impact/urgency | Product Sequencing Matrix |
| 4. Communicate & Iterate | Align with leadership and team; refine over time | Living Document |

## 2. Identifying Strategic Priorities

### What Are Strategic Priorities?

**Definition**: Top-down priorities defined and communicated by leadership—the way org strategy gets translated into your product workplan.

**Where to find them:**
- Board notes
- C-suite presentations
- Quarterly goals
- Discussions with leadership

**Examples:**
- Airbnb host growth team: Increase host growth by X% annually
- Tinder: Improve engagement of Gen Z audience by Y% annually

> "Product is often the most important lever a company has to achieve its strategy. As a result, product leaders play an essential role in a company's success. Product leaders must understand and enable the strategic priorities in order to succeed."
> — Ravi Mehta

### Two Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Not focusing on most relevant priorities**

Company priorities are designed for the collective org, not individual product leaders. You must understand your scope.

**Pitfall 2: Lacking clarity on priorities**

Three causes:
- Multiple strategic priorities communicated
- Implicit/not fully articulated priorities
- Variance based on company stage

### The Strategic Priority Map

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Priorities**

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Relevant** | Within your sphere of influence | Act as north star for your strategy |
| **Peripheral** | Can influence but don't own directly | Include in map; provide insight to owners |
| **Tangential** | Explicitly outside your influence | Don't include; defines what you won't work on |

> "Which pieces of your strategy are you able to do within the scope now vs. what do you need to get buy-in to do?"
> — Fareed Mosavat

**Tinder Monetization Example:**

| Type | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Relevant | Increase revenue through existing monetization offerings; provide new paid features |
| Peripheral | Improve recommendation algorithm (impacts revenue, but different team owns) |
| Tangential | User acquisition (team measured on per-user basis, not total acquisition) |

**Step 2: Clarify Each Priority**

| Element | Definition | Example (Airbnb) | Example (Tinder) |
|---------|------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Outcome** | Action priority focuses on achieving | Host growth | Engagement of Gen Z |
| **Criteria** | Direction + magnitude | Increase by X% | Improve by Y% |
| **Rationale** | Why this priority matters | Hosts add inventory → acquisition + retention | Gen Z = long-term viability; needs differ from past generations |

---

## 3. Brainstorming Product Work

### Why Brainstorming Fails

**Mistake 1: Copying competitors without understanding their strategy**

> "If you copy competitors, you will only build something worse than what they have and later than they have it. This isn't a winning strategy."
> — Helen Sims (skating to where the puck is metaphor)

*Instagram IGTV Example*: Built as YouTube response, but lacked virality and monetization mechanisms. Eventually removed the IGTV button.

**Mistake 2: Doubling down on past successful work types**

*HomeAway vs. Airbnb Example*:
- HomeAway: Solely growth mindset → incremental improvements
- Airbnb: Balanced approach—treated supply as both growth AND PMF problem → launched Experiences, new markets

### The Product Work Ideation Session

**Definition**: Structured meeting where team pitches product work ideas supporting strategic priorities, then filters to determine what goes in workplan.

**Goals:**
- Foster creativity (novel ideas)
- Keep team focused (relevant to priorities)

**Output**: Product work ideas covering all four types for each strategic priority.

### Preparing for the Session

**1. Provide Context for Strategic Priorities**

Share elements from Strategic Priority Map before session:
- What priorities are in scope
- Why these priorities matter
- Rationale and assumptions

*Tinder Gen Z Example*: Initially used growth experiments to define hypotheses about Gen Z needs, then shifted to PMF expansion for step-function change in engagement.

**2. Define Charter Principles**

| Type | Question | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Guardrails** | What could derail product work? | Top-down constraints from leadership |
| **Lessons Learned** | What insights are critical to success? | Bottom-up knowledge from past work |
| **Validated Capabilities** | What has succeeded that we should leverage? | Existing strengths to build on |

*Tinder Gen Z Example*:
- **Guardrail**: Deliver unique, innovative experience (fresh apps constantly target Gen Z)
- **Lesson Learned**: Interactive content—Gen Z wants to share, comment, co-create
- **Validated Capability**: Scale—capital for Hollywood-quality content, millions of concurrent users

**Recommendation**: Focus on top 3-5 charter principles. Too many artificially constrains thinking.

**3. Set Participation Expectations**

- **Attendance**: Who attends, who's optional, who's informed
- **Roles**: How each attendee should contribute
- **Pre-work**: Product work ideas covering all four types, adhering to charter principles

### Managing the Session Agenda

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Introduction** | Set ground rules | One person presents uninterrupted; no re-pitching; feedback in brainstorm phase |
| **Idea Pitches** | Each attendee presents | No feedback yet; leader groups ideas into four types |
| **Brainstorm Gaps** | Fill empty quadrants | Teams over-index on familiar work; force thinking across all types |
| **Idea Filtering** | Remove least aligned ideas | Cut what doesn't support priorities |

**Common Gap**: Scaling work often underrepresented. At feature/growth-focused companies, PMF expansion is also forgotten.

*Tinder Example*: Scrapped VR idea—not enough Gen Z access to VR hardware within time horizon.

## 4. Developing the Product Workplan

### The Short-Term Trap

> "Too often, teams prioritize short-term results over long-term value creation. Like steroids, the short-term injections give the appearance of enduring strength, but weaken the patient over time. Great product leaders create sustainable value by laddering day-to-day product work into strategy."
> — Ravi Mehta

### The Product Sequencing Matrix

Categorize product work by **Impact** (value creation aligned with priorities) and **Urgency** (how soon needed to reach priorities).

| | High Urgency | Low Urgency |
|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | **Cornerstone Work** (do first) | **Important but Flexible** (prep/validate) |
| **Low Impact** | **Supporting Work** (mitigate/queue) | **Non-Essential** (deprioritize) |

### Evaluating Impact

| Factor | Question | Higher Impact When... |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **Upside** | How many users touched? What magnitude of value? | High reach + high value |
| **Strategy Intersection** | Does this support multiple priorities? | Supports 2+ priorities |
| **Compounding vs. Linear** | Do returns compound or stay fixed? | Returns compound over time |
| **Differentiation** | Is this distinct from competitors? | Novel approach or unique capability |

**TripAdvisor ML/NLP Example** (Strategy Intersection):
Single investment supported four priorities:
1. Increased revenue (personalized results)
2. Improved SEO (better landing pages)
3. Improved internal search (reduced SEO dependence)
4. Increased trust (better fraud detection)

**TripAdvisor Save Feature Example** (Compounding):
Save → more likely to return → better personalization data → more saves → better SEO → more returns

**TripAdvisor TripCollective Example** (Differentiation):
Points and badges for contributions (Top Contributor, Boutique Hotel Expert, Helpful Reviewer) → significant increase in contributions → cemented differentiated position.

### Evaluating Urgency

| Factor | Question | Higher Urgency When... |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **Sequencing** | Is this required for other work? | Prerequisite for cornerstone work |
| **Competition** | Are there competitive pressures? | Near-term, severe threat |
| **Leadership Expectations** | Is there explicit time horizon? | Short leadership-defined deadline |

**Four Types of Sequencing:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Learning | Validate hypothesis before committing | Tinder's U, Spring Break, Festival modes → validated Gen Z insights → Swipe Night |
| Technical | Work X required before work Z | Tinder tested Swipe Night components in isolation (streaming, survey, counter) |
| User Behavior | Current behavior → intermediate step → target behavior | TripAdvisor: Browse → Save → Trip Plan → Itinerary → Personalization |
| Asset | Need content, data, or resource first | TripAdvisor needed behavior data before personalization algorithm |

**Slack vs. Microsoft Teams Example** (Competition):
- Proximity: Near-term threat (same enterprise customers)
- Severity: High (Microsoft could bundle + existing salesforce)
- Result: High urgency to build enterprise features

### Mapping to the Matrix

*Tinder COVID-19 Example*:

| Quadrant | Example Work | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Cornerstone** | MVP video chat | Prevent churn to competitors; competitive pressure |
| **Non-Essential** | Portrait/landscape orientation | Nice-to-have; no urgency |
| **Important but Flexible** | Video profiles | Likely high impact; not needed for immediate threat |
| **Supporting** | Trust & safety for video | Small user impact; but can't launch without it |

### Handling Difficult Quadrants

**Important but Flexible Work:**

Two risks if put off:
1. Becomes higher urgency (competitors pursue similar work)
2. Continuously pushed off (never feels right time)

**Solution**: Find intermediate work that lays foundation
- Project planning and scoping
- Smaller pieces of work
- Research, prototyping, experimentation

**Supporting Work:**

Risks if delayed:
- Workarounds become cumbersome
- Problems fester and grow until high importance

**Solution**: Create mitigation plan
- What workaround/temporary solution?
- How long comfortable with mitigation?

### Product Workplan Document

Six elements for each product work item:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Description** | Few words summarizing the idea |
| **Product Work Type** | Feature, Growth, PMF Expansion, or Scaling |
| **Sequencing Category** | Cornerstone, Non-Essential, Important but Flexible, Supporting |
| **Strategic Priority** | Which priority this supports |
| **Next Steps** | Include in roadmap / Commit capacity to validate / Queue / Deprioritize |
| **Date Added** | Track how long work sits in plan |

## 5. Communicating & Iterating

### Why Communication Matters

After developing the workplan, you have knowledge not in the roadmap:
- Which strategic priorities you focused on and why
- Your approach to achieving them
- How and why you sequenced product work

### Communicate Up vs. Down

| Direction | Audience Needs | Emphasis |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Up** (Leadership) | Execution confidence | **HOW** will we reach priorities? |
| **Down** (Team) | Alignment and context | **WHY** are we doing this work? |

**Communicating Up** — Address three questions:
1. How will we reach strategic priorities?
2. How will product strategy drive progress toward company priorities?
3. How is roadmap structured to reach product strategy?

> "Product is one of the most important levers executives have to achieve the company's strategy. Great product leaders understand this. They don't just communicate their product strategy, they build confidence in it."
> — Ravi Mehta

**Communicating Down** — Address three questions:
1. Why are these the strategic priorities?
2. Why is this our product strategy?
3. Why this sequence? Why isn't other work in the plan?

### Two Communication Mistakes

**Big Bang**: Mass communication to leadership and team simultaneously
- Result: Manager and senior reports feel bypassed

**Blank Thud**: Delayed or incomplete communication
- Result: Stakeholders feel uninvolved; lack alignment; missed feedback

### Iterative Release Communication

Like product releases—start small, progressively expand:

| Phase | Audience Up | Audience Down | Feedback Type |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Direct supervisor | Group leads | Detailed feedback |
| 2 | CPO/exec | Team leads | High-level challenges |
| 3 | Full leadership team | Entire team | Clarifying (not changing) |

### Iterating the Workplan

**Don't put strategy on autopilot.** Problems from not iterating:
- Maintaining strategy when work underperforms
- Outgrowing strategy as environment changes
- Firefighting by not anticipating problems

### When to Revisit

**Trigger 1: Changes in Strategic Priorities**

New north star = new strategy direction.

*Instagram Example*: IGTV (long-form video for YouTube) → TikTok explodes → Reels (short-form video)

**Trigger 2: Changes in Charter Principles**

Guardrails, lessons learned, or capabilities change = how you reach priorities changes.

*Instagram Stories Example*: Initially mimicked Snapchat (photo editing focus) → shifted charter principle to community/social interaction → added tagging and social features.

### Tracking Trends in Your Workplan

| Trend | Signal | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Firefighting** | Most work in Cornerstone quadrant | Allocate time to Important-but-Flexible and Supporting work |
| **One-Dimensional** | Same work type dominates Cornerstone | Diversify types of product work |
| **Stagnation** | Work stays in same quadrant 2+ periods | Reclassify or develop execution plan |

**Firefighting Example** (Facebook): After Cambridge Analytica, user scaling work (privacy, content moderation, trust/safety) became cornerstone work that had been important-but-flexible.

**One-Dimensional Example**: Feature team treating every problem as "add new features" without improving existing features or addressing other work types.

## 6. Case Study: Slack (Bottom-Up SaaS)

### Four Phases of Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Key Insight |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Viral Growth** | End-user adoption, freemium model | Cross-company loops (open-source communities, users creating new team accounts) |
| **2. Integration Platform** | First-party integrations, third-party developer platform | Built platform with single core product (market growing fast enough; horizontal expansion; consistent user needs) |
| **3. Up-Market Expansion** | Enterprise features | True expansion, not pivot—maintained SMB virality while adding enterprise |
| **4. Cross-Side Network Effects** | Guest users → Shared Channels → Slack Connect | Cross-company collaboration |

### Key Takeaways

> "While they shipped thousands of improvements and features at Slack over the last five years, most of Slack's success can be attributed to just a few key strategic initiatives."
> — Fareed Mosavat

> "If we could do it all over again, we might have tried to build more network effects earlier. But in retrospect, focusing on creating a secure product that had the same private feel as email may have helped us in our early stages."
> — Fareed Mosavat

## 7. Case Study: HubSpot (B2B Multi-Product)

### Eight Phases of Evolution

1. Initial inbound marketing tool
2. All-in-one marketing platform (mid-market dominance)
3. Attempted platform (failed—insufficient scale)
4. Mid-market expansion to Sales/CRM
5. Up-market, down-market, international expansion
6. Mid-market expansion to Customer Support
7. Successful app marketplace (sufficient scale achieved)
8. CMS Hub spinout

### Key Pattern

**Constant cycle**: Plant PMF expansion seed → Grow → Replant

### Key Takeaways

- **Mid-market focus** enabled differentiation (all-in-one solved pain point enterprises/SMBs didn't have)
- **Adjacent products** created virtuous adoption/retention cycle (enter through sales, adopt marketing, or vice versa)
- **Platform timing**: Failed first attempt; succeeded when critical mass achieved
- **International** required adapting growth model (Germany: content not trusted → replaced company-generated content loop)

---

## 8. Case Study: Match Group (Product Segmentation)

### Three Key Questions for Product Segmentation

1. When to add new product lines?
2. When to build vs. buy?
3. How much to centralize strategy?

### Four Phases of Evolution

1. Match.com founding (desktop dating portal)
2. Shift to mobile / Tinder introduction
3. Adjacent user expansion (OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Hinge)
4. International expansion (Eureka, Hawaya)

### When to Add New Products

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Tech changes** | Mobile shift → Tinder (desktop Match.com wouldn't appeal to mobile-first) |
| **Behavioral changes** | Serious dating preference → Hinge ("designed to be deleted") |
| **Emerging segments** | Middle East market → Hawaya (culturally conservative needs) |

> "As great products fill user needs, new needs often emerge. For example, Facebook empowered people to share a forever timeline... This solved a social need, but created a new need for a more intimate space. Snapchat was able to jump in."
> — Ravi Mehta

### Build vs. Buy

Buy when:
- Specific skills/targeting needed to acquire
- Established network of users to build on

Match leverages extensive dating knowledge to increase value of acquisitions quickly.

### Centralization Spectrum

| Level | Downside |
|-------|----------|
| Over-centralized | Slow to change; coordination problems; missed opportunities |
| Under-centralized | Product overlap; inefficiencies; cannibalization |

> "In most markets, it is better to have some strategic overlap that comes with under-centralization than to incur the tax of moving too slowly due to over-centralized decision making."
> — Ravi Mehta

---

## 9. Case Study: Pinterest (Social Network)

### Social Product Value Evolution

| Phase | Value Proposition |
|-------|-------------------|
| Standalone | Pin content to collect/reference (tool) |
| Network | Share content with friends (multiplayer) |
| Data | Recommendations based on all user data (personalized discovery) |

### Six Phases of Evolution

1. **Initial tool functionality** — Pin It Forward campaign; craft creator community
2. **Facebook Open Graph** — Piggybacked on FB network; came for tool, stayed for network
3. **SEO pivot** — FB added restrictions; content indexed in search; acquisition grew but retention declined (no friend connection)
4. **Data network effects** — Community data drove personalized recommendations; shifted from social learning to interest-based discovery
5. **Internationalization** — Couldn't just translate; needed local content, local brands, localized feeds
6. **Monetization** — Ads (need ~100M MAU), then commerce

### Key Takeaways

> "We couldn't just start showing Europeans recipes with tablespoons and pounds as the unit of measurement. They just got frustrated."
> — Casey Winters

> "When we talked to French people about Pinterest after they tried it, they would say things like 'I can read English, but I don't want to.' We hadn't done a good job of localizing their feeds to local content."
> — Casey Winters

**Foursquare Counter-Example**: Over-focused on data value (selling to restaurants) → user experience suffered → data became stale → vicious cycle.

> "Before you have critical mass of users and content, you need to focus on utility, and then once you have enough users, you can start building a community around it."
> — Alex Zhu, TikTok founder

---

## 10. Case Study: Airbnb (Marketplace)

### Five Phases of Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Key Work |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1. Local Market Focus** | Establish foundational value prop | NYC only; non-scalable work (founder photos, musician outreach) |
| **2. Growth** | Reduce friction for guests/hosts | Photo program, host guarantee, trust features, instant book |
| **3. Layer Acquisition Channels** | Multiple growth loops | Craigslist scraping, viral loops (WOM, referral, social, guest-to-host), paid, SEO city guides |
| **4. Up-Market Expansion** | Direct hotel competition | Superhost quality, Hotel Tonight acquisition, Luxe category, boutique hotels |
| **5. New Products** | Adjacent offerings | Experiences, long-term stays |

### Key Takeaways

**Non-Scalable Start**: Did things that don't scale to bootstrap marketplace liquidity.

**Relational → Transactional**: Moved from person-to-person booking decisions to instant book (hotel-like ease).

**Instant Book Adoption**: Incentivized hosts with search ranking boost and safety tools (verified ID).

**Exclusivity + Comprehensiveness**:

> "There are two ways to build a marketplace, have something exclusive or have everything. Either you offer something unique relative to your competitors or you offer more selection. It's pretty rare to see a company do both."
> — Casey Winters

Airbnb started with exclusivity (unique experience, lower price), then expanded to comprehensiveness.
