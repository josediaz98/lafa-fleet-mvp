## Executive Summary

The fundamental differentiator between good and great Product Managers is **leverage**—the ability to generate outsized impact with similar effort. While good PMs produce steady incremental results and manage day-to-day operations effectively, great PMs consistently achieve needle-moving wins while appearing to operate effortlessly.

This leverage manifests through five distinct sources: identifying needle-moving work that escapes incrementalism, empowering teams to make decisions autonomously, securing leadership buy-in for initiatives, developing product intuition through systematic exposure to customer signals, and maintaining focused effort on the highest-return activities.

Great PMs operationalize these leverage sources through eight key deliverables: product strategy, vision narrative, customer insights, metrics dashboards, product roadmaps, product specs, team OKRs, and decision alignment. Each deliverable has specific tools and frameworks that transform routine PM work into high-leverage output. The deliverables are interconnected—strategy shapes vision, informs feedback prioritization, and determines metrics; these together drive roadmap decisions, which cascade into OKRs and specs.

The core insight is that PM effectiveness comes not from working harder on standard deliverables, but from approaching each deliverable with rigorous, systematic thinking that creates compounding leverage over time.

## 1. The Leverage Framework

### Core Thesis: Leverage as the PM Multiplier

Great PMs operate like a lever system in physics—they move higher loads (better product outcomes) with similar effort (time invested) by creating an effective lever (specific tools and tactics).

**The Good vs. Great PM Gap:**

| Dimension | Good PM | Great PM |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Resources | Struggles to get support despite well-formed roadmaps | Regularly gets full support and resources |
| Impact | Steady incremental results, rarely game-changing | Needle-moving wins, outsized company impact |
| Operations | Effective at meetings, but constant fire-fighting | Manages everything seemingly effortlessly |

**Root Cause:** The difference isn't visible in deliverables (both create specs, roadmaps, dashboards). The difference is in the *thinking behind* those deliverables.

> "Many PMs over-index on execution because it feels more real. But game-changing outcomes come from good use of leverage, not just pure execution."
> — Sachin Rekhi, former Head of LinkedIn Sales Navigator

> "Early in my career, I was so caught up in just keeping the ball moving. Only after I created the space to think about how to best direct the ball did I see a major jump in outcomes."
> — Britt Jamison, Lead PM at Webflow and Slack

## 2. The Five Sources of Leverage

### 2.1 Needle-Moving Work

**Definition:** Identifying and executing longer-term initiatives that create magnitude shifts in product outcomes, even if they lack immediate impact.

**The Incrementalism Trap:**
- PMs spend majority of sprints on small, quickly-implementable changes yielding minor improvements
- Bi-weekly sprints, OKRs, and leadership pressure create bias toward short-term, easily-quantifiable wins
- This systematically crowds out longer-term, higher-impact work

**The Escape:**
Great PMs balance short-term incremental work (1-3% gains) with longer-term initiatives that yield double or triple-digit improvements.

> "Short-term incremental work is easily doable and might yield small 1-3% gains. But you have to balance this with the longer-term work that has the potential to yield double or even triple-digit improvements."
> — Helen Sims, former Product Lead at Airbnb, Head of Product at Reforge

### 2.2 Team Empowerment

**Definition:** Effectively empowering the team to make great decisions without the PM.

**The Bottleneck Problem:**
- PM becomes the chokepoint for bug triaging, tactical design decisions, and countless micro-decisions
- Team constantly turns to PM for calls on tactical details
- PM time consumed by decisions others could make

**The Solution:**
Remove yourself as bottleneck → frees PM time for strategic thinking → enables team to operate more efficiently.

### 2.3 Leadership Buy-In

**Definition:** Getting support from key decision-makers for initiatives.

**The Mechanics:**
- PMs need sufficient time and resources to pursue initiatives
- Resources require leadership agreement that initiatives are high enough priority
- Great PMs understand how to adjust selling style to different leaders
- They socialize goals in ways that earn support from the most important decision-makers

### 2.4 Product Intuition

**Definition:** The instinct to make great product decisions even without detailed information.

**Key Insight:** Product intuition is a *developed* skill, not an innate trait.

**The Development Process:**
Constant exposure to customer signals → thousands of data points accumulated → instinctive understanding of what will work.

> "You develop product intuition by constantly exposing yourself to what customers are saying. Over the course of thousands of data points, you start to instinctively understand what will work and what won't."
> — Sachin Rekhi

### 2.5 Focused Effort

**Definition:** Concentrating team work on the most important initiatives.

**Common Failure Modes:**
1. Unclear on which areas yield highest return
2. Know the areas but lack processes to focus team on them
3. Result: efforts spread too thin, suboptimal outcomes

**The Solution:**
Constantly test and refine understanding of critical product levers → structure execution processes (OKRs, roadmaps) to focus on improving these levers.

## 3. The Eight PM Deliverables

Great PMs create leverage by executing each deliverable systematically with rigorous thought.

### 3.1 Product Strategy

**What It Is:** Your company's plan for how your product will win the market.

**The Iceberg Problem:**
- Most PMs understand strategy only at surface level
- Viewing surface as complete picture causes investment in misaligned initiatives
- Result: minor or insufficient product impact

**The Solution: Reforge Product Strategy Map**
- Understand strategy at depth, including specific nuances
- Enables identification of truly needle-moving work
- Creates alignment between initiatives and strategic goals

### 3.2 Vision Narrative

**What It Is:** A one or two page narrative explaining the PM's scope vision.

**Three Common Failures:**
1. Vision doesn't tackle aspirational enough problem for needle-moving results
2. Insufficient detail leaves vision too high-level to empower team decisions
3. Failure to get leadership buy-in on scope vision

**The Solution:**
Write detailed vision narratives → follow framework for gaining leadership buy-in.

### 3.3 Customer Insights

**What It Is:** Constantly gathering and discovering unique customer insights to build game-changing products.

**The Overwhelm Problem:**
- Too many feedback sources and channels
- Processing all without spending all time on data pulling and formatting

**The Solution: Feedback Management Systems**
- Automate collection and processing from multiple sources
- Make parsing constant user exposure manageable
- Develop product intuition through systematic exposure

### 3.4 Metrics Dashboards

**What It Is:** Continually assessing, reporting on, and deriving insights from product health.

**The Metrics Sprawl Problem:**
- Dashboards with far too many metrics (50+ in some cases)
- Lose sight of important trends and insights
- Can't explain why specific metrics move or which matter most

**The Solution: Lever Dashboards**
- Highly focused on only most important metrics
- Track outcome metrics (ultimate business/user value measures)
- Track KPIs (key input metrics that influence outcomes)
- Focus team energy on needle-moving metrics
- Build product intuition through constant observation and investigation

### 3.5 Product Roadmaps

**What It Is:** Dictates what gets built and when.

**The Scoring Trap:**
- Simple score-based approaches (RICE, feature voting) have biases
- Produce roadmaps devoid of strategy
- Less needle-moving, less focused than possible
- Leadership feels roadmaps lack strategic connection → harder to get buy-in

**The Solution: 4D Roadmapping**
- Brainstorm and prioritize in more strategic, focused way
- Identify more needle-moving work
- Create more focus in execution
- Better able to sell roadmap to leadership

### 3.6 Team OKRs

**What It Is:** Objectives and Key Results—goal-setting and review process.

**Well-done OKRs create leverage through:** focus, team empowerment, leadership buy-in, product intuition building.

**Common Failures:**
1. Measuring outputs ("launch 15 blog posts") instead of outcomes ("gain 1000 new subscribers")
2. Treating OKRs as pure execution tool, missing reflection/learning opportunity
3. OKRs' focusing power creates overly localized focus

**The Solution: OKR Loop**
- **Set:** Outcome-oriented OKRs to focus effort
- **Socialize:** Get leadership buy-in, empower team
- **Post-mortem:** Rigorous review to refine product intuition

### 3.7 Product Specs

**What It Is:** Documents guiding product implementation.

**The Spectrum Problem:**
- Ultra-lightweight specs: constantly pulled into ad hoc discussions for clarity
- Highly prescriptive specs: still pulled into discussions, now as decision-maker for everything

**Both extremes destroy leverage.**

**The Solution: Empowering Product Specs**
- Provide context on what you're trying to accomplish
- Explain key principles to adhere to during implementation
- Right amount of guidance without micromanaging
- Team empowered to make decisions within framework

### 3.8 Decision Alignment

**What It Is:** Making or facilitating decisions involving multiple stakeholders.

**The Decision Dilemma:**
- Constant pressure to decide with multiple stakeholders
- Struggle with how much to invest in different decision types
- Struggle with involving right stakeholders

**Two Failure Modes:**
1. Slow, consensus-based decisions with maximum stakeholder input
2. Fast decisions with limited input

Both are suboptimal.

**The Solution: Decision Architecture**
PMs conceive of their role as decision architect for the organization → more efficient and effective decisions.

## 4. How Deliverables Interconnect

The eight deliverables form an integrated system:

```
Product Strategy (starting point)
       ↓
       ├→ Shapes what's realistic for Vision
       ├→ Prioritizes Customer Feedback by segment
       └→ Determines Metrics for Lever Dashboards

       ↑↓ (bidirectional)

Feedback + Metrics insights → Update Product Strategy

Strategy + Vision + Insights + Metrics
       ↓
       └→ Starting points for Roadmap brainstorming/prioritization

Roadmap Priorities
       ↓
       ├→ OKRs to track improvement
       └→ Product Specs to write

Throughout: Decision Alignment on all micro/macro decisions
```
