Team members: *\[Names of team members\]*

## **The Opportunity**

*\[What is the problem you’re solving?\]*  
*\[Thinking back to the 4 lenses from 4D Roadmaps, which of the 4 lenses does this feature advance? This helps your team understand why you are prioritizing this feature and how they may want to design or engineer the feature differently.\]*

## **Target Audience**

*\[What is the specific sub-audience you’re serving?\]*  
*\[How do they differ from your overall audience or other audience segments that might change how you implement the feature?\]*

## **Customer Insights**

*\[What are your most important insights from your user research? Any particularly counterintuitive and material ones that affect your feature implementation?\]*  
*\[What user quotes support those insight themes?\]*

## **Competitive Insights**

*\[How have your competitors or other best-in-class companies implemented this feature?\]*  
*\[Based on your research, what functionality is table-stakes, and what should your team emphasize differentiation on?\]*  
*Possible research avenues:*

* *Reading through competitor marketing materials*  
* *Reading through product reviews \- e.g. on app stores, review aggregators like G2Crowd, or on their forums*  
* *Directly try your competitor product\]*

## **Success Metrics**

*Having a narrow shortlist of priority metrics and actively calling out metrics you don’t care about impacting or don’t want to impact empowers your team to make better trade-off decisions.* 

### Priority success metrics

*\[What is the shortlist of metrics you care about moving?\]*

### Deprioritized metrics

*\[What are the metrics you actively don’t care about moving?\]*

### Guardrail metrics

*\[What are the metrics you want to make sure you don’t negatively impact?\]*

## 

## **Scope**

*\[What are the key functionalities you need to implement now or might want to implement later? Knowing what functionality you may want to implement later helps engineering optimize their architecture earlier\]*

### Now

* 

### Next

* 

### Later

* 

## **Experience**

*\[What will the user experience look and feel like? We suggest illustrating with low-fidelity, annotated wireframes at first, and then moving onto higher-fidelity prototypes later on\]*  
*\[We suggest having design completely own this section to better empower them\]*

## 

## **Implementation Details**

*\[What are only the most important technical details to clarify? These would be details that significantly alter the user experience. We suggest leaving the rest of technical implementation decision-making to engineering, to better empower them\]*

## **Launch Plan**

*\[If applicable, what are the launch phases for this feature? This helps engineering know what server load to expect and whether feature flags are required\]*

## **Investigative Metrics**

*\[What metrics do you want instrumented as part of this feature? Each metric should be related to answering at least one future question on how to change the feature\]*

## **FAQ**

*\[What major decisions have been made over the course of this feature’s development? What was the rationale for each of those decisions? Logging this will help you cut down on time spent doing ad hoc debates about feature direction\]*
