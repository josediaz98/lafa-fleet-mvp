**Instructor Background:** Michael Sippy is a veteran product leader who started in enterprise software in 1991, was among the first dozen bloggers (1995), ran consumer product at Twitter, and spent five years at Medium navigating their pivot from advertising to subscription model. His teaching draws heavily from the Medium vs Substack case study.

---

## Executive Summary

This session introduces the foundational architecture of product management through a deceptively simple claim: PMs are ultimately responsible for only three questions—what problem are you solving, who are you solving it for, and how will you measure success. Everything else, Sippy argues, is collaborative work with design, engineering, marketing, and sales. This framing matters because it liberates PMs from the illusion that they must personally own every decision while clarifying where their unique accountability lies.

The session's pedagogical centerpiece is the Medium versus Substack case study, which illustrates how two companies building similar products (text on the internet, monetized through subscriptions) arrived at radically different outcomes because they answered the "who are you solving it for" question differently. Medium chose readers; Substack chose writers. That single strategic choice cascaded through every subsequent decision—value proposition, channel strategy, monetization model, and competitive positioning. The case demonstrates that product strategy is not a template to fill out once but a dynamic hypothesis that must be continuously revisited and tested.

Sippy introduces the six-dimension Product Strategy Map (target audience, problem solving, value proposition, strategic differentiation, channel strategy, monetization) not as a rigid framework but as a set of questions that force clarity. He emphasizes that these dimensions are "scale invariant"—applicable whether you're working on a single feature, a product area, or an entire company. The discipline isn't in completing the template; it's in using the questions to surface assumptions that might otherwise remain invisible.

The session also tackles the perennial PM anxiety of "when is good enough?" Sippy's answer draws on Amazon's distinction between one-way and two-way door decisions. For reversible decisions, bias toward action—ship something to learn from real market data. For irreversible decisions, invest more in upfront validation, but recognize that even then, you're testing a hypothesis, not seeking certainty. The fastest path to learning is often the smallest intervention that generates real feedback.

Finally, Sippy addresses vision narratives—perhaps the most difficult PM skill to teach through case studies. His key insight is structural: a vision narrative follows the arc of a story, with your target customer as protagonist, their problem as the challenge, your channel strategy as how they discover you, and your product as the resolution. And because people don't read, the medium of communication matters as much as the content: video walkthroughs, interactive prototypes, and repeated verbal reinforcement often outperform lengthy strategy documents.

The meta-lesson running through all of this is leverage. Product management is a stretched role with infinite demands; the frameworks exist not to create work but to help PMs focus on decisions that actually move the business.

---

## 1. The PM's Core Responsibility

### Three Questions, Everything Else is Collaborative

**Core Concept**

Sippy makes a provocative claim that cuts through much PM anxiety: "There are really only three questions a PM needs to answer. The rest of them can be answered collaboratively with your team." Those three questions are:

1. What problem are you solving?
2. Who are you solving it for?
3. How will you measure success?

This framing is liberating because it acknowledges that product management is inherently collaborative while clarifying where the PM's unique accountability lies. You don't need to personally own the tech stack decision (that's engineering), the go-to-market strategy (that's sales and marketing), or the visual design (that's design). What you must own is the clarity about the problem space, the target user, and the definition of success.

**Underlying Mechanism**

Why these three specifically? Because they form the constraints within which all other decisions make sense. If you're unclear about who you're solving for, you can't evaluate whether a particular feature serves them. If you're unclear about the problem, you can't distinguish a good solution from a clever-but-irrelevant one. If you're unclear about success metrics, you have no way to know if you've won or lost.

The rest—channel strategy, monetization, feature prioritization, technical architecture—are downstream decisions that should be made collaboratively with people who have relevant expertise. The PM's job is to ensure those downstream decisions are coherent with the upstream choices about problem and audience.

**Connections to Other Ideas**

This framing connects directly to the Product Strategy Map: the three questions map to Target Audience, Problem Solving, and a combination of Monetization/Differentiation (which together define success). It also connects to Sippy's point about leverage—the PM's scarcest resource is attention, and these three questions are where that attention should concentrate.

**Practical Application**

When you feel overwhelmed by competing demands, return to these three questions. Ask: "Do I have clarity on who we're building for?" If not, that's your priority—not roadmap mechanics or sprint planning. When stakeholders push for features or directions that feel wrong, check whether they conflict with your answers to these questions. The three questions become your filter for what deserves your attention versus what can be delegated or deferred.

**Nuances & Limitations**

This framework assumes you have a collaborative team. In dysfunctional organizations where PMs must compensate for missing functions, the practical scope expands. Additionally, "how will you measure success" is deceptively simple—it actually encompasses strategic differentiation, monetization strategy, and the metrics that prove you're winning. The simplicity is pedagogical, not reductive.

> "The thing that you have sole responsibility for are the problem you're solving, the audience who you're solving it for, and a mix of monetization and strategic differentiation—are you gonna measure success? How do you know this is actually going to work?"

## 2. Product Strategy as Hypothesis

### The Six-Dimension Strategy Map

**Core Concept**

The Product Strategy Map consists of six dimensions that together describe how a product creates and captures value:

1. **Target Audience** — Who specifically are you building for?
2. **Problem Solving** — What problem are you solving for them?
3. **Value Proposition** — What benefit do they receive?
4. **Strategic Differentiation** — How are you different from alternatives?
5. **Channel Strategy** — How will you reach and acquire users?
6. **Monetization Strategy** — How will you generate revenue?

Sippy emphasizes that the purpose isn't filling out a template—"it's not about filling out the template. It's about using these as questions and prompts for your own work." The map is a thinking tool, not a deliverable.

**Underlying Mechanism**

These six dimensions capture the fundamental logic of any product business. The first three (audience, problem, value prop) define your *product fit*—are you building something people want? The second three (differentiation, channels, monetization) define your *market fit*—can you reach those people cost-effectively and generate sustainable revenue?

The insight here is that product-market fit is actually two separate things that both must work. You can have excellent product fit (people love what you built) but terrible market fit (you can't reach them cost-effectively or monetize them). Sippy gives the example of companies relying on Google search for discovery who may face market fit erosion as search behavior shifts to AI assistants—even though their product remains excellent.

**Connections to Other Ideas**

The strategy map connects to the Medium vs Substack case study, where both companies had similar "products" (text on the internet, subscription revenue) but radically different strategy maps because they chose different target audiences. It also connects to the "scale invariant" principle—these questions apply at feature, product, and company levels.

**Practical Application**

Use the six dimensions as a diagnostic checklist, not a document to produce:
- When a project feels stuck, ask which dimension lacks clarity
- When stakeholders disagree, identify which dimension contains the disagreement
- When evaluating competitors, map them on the same dimensions to find strategic openings

For existing products, the exercise reveals assumptions you've made implicitly. For new products, it forces you to confront what you don't know.

**Nuances & Limitations**

Not all six dimensions apply equally at every level. At a feature level, "channel strategy" might translate to "how will users discover this feature exists?" and "monetization" might translate to "how does this contribute to the value users are paying for?" The framework requires interpretation, not mechanical application.

> "I really believe these questions are scale invariant. Meaning that these questions work at the feature level, as well as the product level, as well as the company level."

### Strategy Maps Are Dynamic

**Core Concept**

A product strategy is not a document you write once and reference forever. It's a hypothesis about how the world works that must be continuously revisited based on what you learn. Sippy makes this concrete: "That strategy map evolves over time. It's not you write it once, and then you're done."

**Underlying Mechanism**

The world changes—competitors emerge, customer needs shift, channels become more expensive, new technologies create new possibilities. Your strategy map at launch will become outdated. More importantly, your initial strategy map is based on assumptions and limited data. As you execute and learn, some assumptions prove wrong. A healthy strategy practice incorporates those learnings.

**Practical Application**

Sippy recommends:
- **Annual deep dive**: At least once a year, do the full exercise—revisit outcome-motivation-gap, redo target audience bull's eye, examine monetization and channel strategy changes
- **Quarterly refresh**: Reference the strategy in quarterly planning. "Hey, just to refresh, this is our product strategy." Keep a 1-2 slide summary that you can share quickly
- **Continuous repetition**: "Part of the job of the PM is just saying things over and over and over again because people don't listen and people don't read"

For new team members, have an onboarding artifact: "Here's our product strategy, here are the two slides, if you want the backing material you can go read it."

**Nuances & Limitations**

Revisiting strategy doesn't mean constantly changing it. The annual cadence for deep revision reflects the reality that strategy changes cascade downstream—new channel strategy affects marketing, new monetization affects pricing, new target audience affects product design. Startups iterate faster because they have smaller teams and are explicitly searching for product-market fit.

> "This map isn't static. You really need to keep revisiting it based on learnings... Iterations in that product strategy map will cascade."

## 3. Target Audience Selection

### The Bull's Eye Approach

**Core Concept**

Target audience selection uses a bull's eye model moving from broad to specific:
- **Outer ring (TAM)**: Total addressable market—everyone who could theoretically use your product
- **Middle ring**: Narrowed market—a segment with specific characteristics that make them better fits
- **Center (Core)**: Your primary focus—the users you're explicitly designing for

The bull's eye forces specificity. It's tempting to claim you're building for "everyone who reads online," but that's not actionable. The bull's eye forces you to articulate who you're *really* building for, right now.

**Underlying Mechanism**

Specificity enables better decisions. When you know your core user is "professional journalists seeking financial independence after leaving traditional media," you can evaluate features against that user. Does this serve them? When you know your core user is "curious readers seeking expert perspectives unavailable in mainstream media," you design a different product.

Medium's bull's eye was: TAM = billion+ educated English speakers → Narrowed = tens of millions with professional/personal interest in tech, politics, science, personal growth → Core = long-form readers willing to pay for quality content.

**Connections to Other Ideas**

This connects directly to the Medium vs Substack lesson—the core audience choice (readers vs writers) cascaded through the entire strategy. It also connects to the three PM questions: "who are you solving it for" requires this level of specificity to be actionable.

**Practical Application**

When defining your bull's eye:
- Start with the largest conceivable market (this becomes your TAM for investor conversations)
- Ask: "Within this market, who has the strongest version of the problem we solve?" That's your narrowed market
- Ask: "Among those, who can we actually reach, and who would pay?" That's your core

The exercise often reveals uncomfortable truths: maybe your product serves a much smaller market than you hoped, or maybe you've been implicitly designing for the wrong user.

**Nuances & Limitations**

The bull's eye can shift over time. Substack started with professional journalists as their core and has since expanded toward building a reader network. The initial core is a starting point, not a permanent constraint.

> "Really understanding that target user is important because that will cascade into what problem you're solving for them, how will you reach them in your channel strategy, how are you monetizing."

### The Medium vs Substack Lesson

**Core Concept**

Medium and Substack launched similar products—platforms for writing and reading text, monetized through subscriptions—within a year of each other. But they chose different target audiences, and that single decision cascaded into completely different products, strategies, and outcomes.

**Medium's Strategy (2017):**
- Target: Long-form readers willing to pay for quality content
- Problem: "Help me find expert voices and great content in topics I care about"
- Value Prop: Bundled subscription to UGC + professional content, ad-free, with discovery
- Acquisition: SEO and social (virtually no paid marketing)
- Monetization: $5/month or $50/year subscription, revenue shared with writers

**Substack's Strategy (2018):**
- Target: Professional journalists seeking financial independence
- Problem: "Traditional media is collapsing, I need to control my own destiny"
- Value Prop: Simple tools to monetize writing directly through subscriptions
- Acquisition: Paid advances to high-profile writers with large social followings
- Monetization: Writers keep 90%, Substack takes 10% of subscription revenue

**Underlying Mechanism**

The choice of who you're solving for determines everything else:
- **Value proposition differs**: Medium promised readers discovery and access; Substack promised writers independence and revenue
- **Channel strategy differs**: Medium invested in recommendation algorithms and SEO for readers; Substack invested in recruiting writers who would bring their own audiences
- **Monetization differs**: Medium bundled content and shared revenue; Substack enabled direct creator-to-reader payment
- **Competitive positioning differs**: Medium competed with news aggregators for reader subscriptions; Substack competed with traditional media employers for writer loyalty

**Connections to Other Ideas**

This case study is the practical demonstration of why "who are you solving it for" is one of the three essential PM questions. It also illustrates the strategy map's interconnected nature—change one dimension and the others must change too.

**Practical Application**

When evaluating your own product strategy, ask:
- Could we serve a different user with the same underlying capabilities?
- What would change if we did?
- Are we implicitly serving one user while claiming to serve another?

Medium's mistake wasn't choosing readers—it was underinvesting in writers ("we've got the writers, we don't need to worry about them") while a competitor emerged to serve those writers directly.

**Nuances & Limitations**

There's no universally "right" answer to who you should serve. Medium's reader-focused strategy could have worked if Substack hadn't emerged, or if Medium had responded faster to the competitive threat. The lesson isn't "always focus on supply side"—it's "your audience choice is a strategic decision with cascading consequences, so make it deliberately."

> "We were like, we've got the writers. We don't need to really worry about them... That left a massive opening. Substack launched in 2018... Their entire product strategy was focused on writers."

## 4. Product-Market Fit Decomposition

### Product Fit vs Market Fit

**Core Concept**

"Product-market fit" is often treated as a single thing, but Sippy breaks it into two components that must both work:

- **Product fit**: You've built something people want. Users have the problem you're solving, and your solution addresses it.
- **Market fit**: You can reach those users cost-effectively and generate sustainable revenue from them.

You can have product fit without market fit. This is the tragedy of many startups: they build something users love but can't reach them economically or can't monetize them sustainably.

**Underlying Mechanism**

The six-dimension strategy map separates these concerns:
- Target Audience + Problem Solving + Value Proposition = Product Fit
- Strategic Differentiation + Channel Strategy + Monetization Strategy = Market Fit

A product can fail on either side. You might build something nobody wants (no product fit). Or you might build something people want but discover that:
- Customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value (channel strategy failure)
- Users won't pay enough to sustain the business (monetization failure)
- You can't differentiate from competitors who execute better (differentiation failure)

**Connections to Other Ideas**

This decomposition explains why the strategy map has six dimensions, not three. The first three ensure you're building something valuable; the second three ensure you can build a business around it.

**Practical Application**

When diagnosing why a product isn't working, separate the questions:
- Do users who encounter it like it and get value? (Product fit)
- Can we reach enough users at sustainable cost? (Channel fit)
- Will they pay enough to sustain the business? (Monetization fit)

Different diagnoses require different interventions. Product fit problems require product changes; market fit problems might require business model changes, channel pivots, or accepting a different scale.

**Nuances & Limitations**

The two fits interact. If you can only reach users through expensive channels, you might pivot to users you can reach more cheaply—which then requires product changes to serve the new audience. The decomposition is analytical, not sequential.

> "There are times when you have a real user problem, and you've identified a user and their problem, but there's just no willingness or ability to pay. Or you have no effective channel to reach those users in a cost effective way."

### Channel Strategy and Changing Market Dynamics

**Core Concept**

Your channel strategy—how you reach and acquire users—can be disrupted by forces outside your control. Sippy highlights the risk for companies built on Google Search as user behavior shifts toward AI assistants:

"Companies that have relied on Google Search for discovery... that cost of acquiring customers in those channels is gonna go up. Because there are gonna be fewer people using those tools. Their behavior is gonna shift to using agents and AI chat."

**Underlying Mechanism**

Channel strategy isn't static. What works today may not work tomorrow:
- Facebook/Google ate most digital ad dollars, making other ad strategies less viable
- SEO rankings can be disrupted by algorithm changes or new competitors
- AI assistants may disrupt search entirely as a discovery channel

A company with excellent product fit can lose market fit if their channels erode. This is market fit erosion even though "their product is still great."

**Practical Application**

Stress-test your channel strategy:
- What percentage of acquisition depends on a single channel?
- What would happen if that channel's cost doubled?
- What alternative channels exist, and what would it take to develop them?

Medium made a deliberate choice to avoid Facebook tracking pixels, which limited their retargeting ability but protected user privacy. That's a strategic choice with tradeoffs—understand yours.

> "You're gonna have companies that have relied on Google Search for discovery and have been able to build a cost effective business, essentially arbitraging between the cost of having people search for their product... and that market fit is gonna basically start to erode even though their product is still great."

## 5. Bias Toward Action

### One-Way vs Two-Way Doors

**Core Concept**

Decisions fall into two categories, borrowing from Amazon:

- **One-way doors**: Irreversible or very difficult to reverse. Going through commits you.
- **Two-way doors**: Reversible. You can go back and try a different path.

The decision type should determine how much validation you do before acting.

**Underlying Mechanism**

Two-way door decisions should be made quickly because:
- The cost of being wrong is low (you can reverse)
- The best way to learn is through real market feedback
- Delay itself has costs (opportunity cost, slower learning)

One-way door decisions warrant more upfront validation because:
- Reversing is expensive or impossible
- Mistakes have lasting consequences
- But even then, you're still testing a hypothesis—you never have perfect information

**Practical Application**

Before major decisions, ask:
- If this doesn't work, can we reverse it?
- What would reversing cost?
- What's the cost of delay vs the value of more information?

For two-way doors: ship faster, learn from real data, iterate. For one-way doors: invest in validation, seek more certainty, but accept you'll never have complete information.

> "When there are one-way door decisions... those types of decisions require obviously a little bit more certitude... and a little bit more fortitude of, like, we don't have perfect information, this is a one-way door decision, and we are going to have enough information to go make that. I bias towards action all the time."

### Frank Robinson's "30 Meetings" Test

**Core Concept**

Before writing code, validate that customers care enough about the problem to engage with you. Sippy's mentor Frank Robinson (credited as the inspiration for Steve Blank's customer development work) had a simple test: "If you can't get 30 meetings to talk about your product idea, you don't have a product."

**Underlying Mechanism**

The 30 meetings test validates several things simultaneously:
- Customers have the problem you think they have
- The problem is important enough that they'll spend time discussing it
- You can reach and engage your target audience
- Your articulation of the problem resonates

The process of getting 30 meetings also teaches you:
- How to pitch the problem
- Who responds vs who doesn't
- What language resonates

**Practical Application**

Before significant product investment, test whether you can get customer engagement:
- Can you get meetings/calls with target users?
- Do they recognize the problem when you describe it?
- How do they currently solve it?
- What would they pay for a better solution?
- Who else should you talk to?

You're not validating your solution—you're validating the problem and your ability to reach customers who have it.

> "If you can't get 30 meetings to talk with you about your product idea, you don't have a product... It's fascinating because he's totally right."

### The Scientific Method for Product

**Core Concept**

Product development is hypothesis testing. Sippy argues this is literal, not metaphorical: "All products and all companies and all features are just tests of a hypothesis."

The scientific method applies directly:
1. Observe the world
2. Form a mental model
3. Develop a hypothesis about what will happen if you do X
4. Test the hypothesis
5. Gather data
6. Communicate findings
7. Adjust and repeat

**Underlying Mechanism**

Framing strategy as hypothesis does several things:
- Reduces attachment to specific approaches (they're hypotheses, not beliefs)
- Emphasizes learning as the goal, not being right
- Encourages minimum viable tests before large investments
- Makes pivoting feel like scientific progress, not failure

The product strategy map is "just another form of hypothesis building"—documenting your hypothesis about customers, problems, channels, and monetization.

**Practical Application**

For any strategic assumption:
- State it as a falsifiable hypothesis
- Identify the smallest test that would generate relevant data
- Run the test and gather data
- Update your strategy based on results

Tests can be: shipping a feature, running a fake door test, testing ad copy, conducting customer interviews, building a prototype for feedback, etc.

> "All products and all companies and all features are just tests of a hypothesis. We are all just scientists operating the lab where you are observing the world, you are forming an opinion about how that world operates, you have a hypothesis that if you do X, it will lead to change Y. Then you're gonna go test that hypothesis."

### "Do the Smallest Thing"

**Core Concept**

When facing uncertainty about strategy or product direction, Sippy's advice is: "Do the smallest thing you can do to reduce the risk. To learn."

**Underlying Mechanism**

Small tests are:
- Faster to execute
- Cheaper if wrong
- Produce learnings you can build on
- Reduce analysis paralysis

Options include:
- Customer conversations
- Observation in natural environments (Sippy used to watch people use Twitter on BART)
- Fake door tests
- Small ad spend to test messaging
- Prototypes for feedback
- Minimum viable features

**Practical Application**

When stuck on "when is good enough to move forward?":
1. Identify your biggest uncertainty
2. Ask: "What's the smallest thing I could do to get data on this?"
3. Do that thing
4. Use the learning to decide next steps

Build the muscle of finding small tests. Over time, you develop intuition about which tests work in which situations.

> "Anything that you can do to reduce the amount of uncertainty, take the smallest step. Sometimes that's actually shipping a feature. Sometimes that's running a fake door test on Google. Sometimes that's spending a little bit of money on ads to see what copy works. Sometimes that's building a prototype... Just go do it."

## 6. Vision & Narrative as Leverage

### Vision Narrative as Story Structure

**Core Concept**

A vision narrative is more effective when structured as a story, mapping directly from your product strategy:

- **Protagonist**: Your target customer
- **Challenge**: Their problem (the outcome-motivation-gap)
- **Discovery**: How they find you (channel strategy)
- **Resolution**: How your product solves their problem (value proposition, differentiation)
- **Transformation**: The benefit they achieve (outcome)

**Underlying Mechanism**

Stories are memorable and engaging in ways that strategy documents are not. By translating strategy into narrative:
- People connect emotionally (they care about the protagonist)
- The logic becomes intuitive (stories have natural cause-and-effect)
- It's easier to spot gaps (if the story doesn't flow, the strategy might have holes)
- It communicates across different learning styles

**Connections to Other Ideas**

The story structure directly parallels the product strategy map. The narrative is the strategy map made human and emotional. This connects to Sippy's emphasis on leverage—a good story does the work of alignment more efficiently than bullet points.

**Practical Application**

To create a vision narrative:
1. Name your customer (even a fictional persona)
2. Describe their situation and problem vividly
3. Show how they discover your solution
4. Demonstrate what changes for them after using it

Test whether the story flows. If you can't make it flow, examine which strategic dimension is unclear.

> "If you connect the product strategy map—who your target customer is and what problem you're solving for them... all of those things, if you think about that as an arc of a story, you have your protagonist, which is your customer. And they have a challenge, which is the problem you have to solve for that customer."

### People Don't Read

**Core Concept**

One of Sippy's most repeated observations: "People don't read. They just don't." This has direct implications for how PMs communicate.

**Underlying Mechanism**

PMs often invest heavily in written documentation—PRDs, strategy docs, memos—and then are frustrated when stakeholders haven't absorbed them. The problem isn't the document quality; it's the medium mismatch. Different people have different learning styles, and many prefer:
- Verbal explanation
- Visual demonstration
- Interactive prototypes
- Video walkthroughs

**Practical Application**

Diversify how you communicate strategy and vision:
- **Loom videos**: Walk through your strategy with passion and visuals
- **Prototypes**: "Concept car" demos that show the vision, even if not functional
- **Repeated verbal communication**: Say the same thing over and over in meetings
- **Short-form summaries**: 1-2 slides for quick reference

The goal is to hook people into the story, then let them go deeper if motivated.

> "A vision narrative does not need to take the form of a thousand word essay. It could be you doing that in a Loom video showing your passion for it. It could be that you make a lovable prototype of the concept car of the feature you're trying to build."

### Repetition is the PM's Job

**Core Concept**

Communicating strategy is not a one-time event. Sippy frames repetition as a core PM responsibility: "Part of the job of the PM is just saying things over and over and over again because people don't listen and people don't read."

**Underlying Mechanism**

Organizations have:
- Turnover (new people who missed the original communication)
- Competing priorities (people forget what's not immediately relevant)
- Information overload (your strategy doc competes with everything else)

To maintain alignment, you must repeatedly refresh people on the strategy—quarterly at minimum, and whenever relevant in roadmap discussions, sprint planning, etc.

**Practical Application**

Build repetition into your process:
- Start quarterly planning with a strategy refresh slide
- Open design reviews with "as a reminder, our target user is..."
- Keep a 1-2 slide strategy summary that you can pull up quickly
- When onboarding new team members, explicitly share the strategy

You will feel like you're saying the same thing too often. That's the right amount.

> "You're gonna get really tired of me telling you this every quarter, but this is our product strategy."

## Connections Map

The ideas in this session form an interconnected system, not isolated concepts.

**The Three Questions Anchor Everything**

The three questions PMs must answer (problem, audience, success) map directly to the six-dimension product strategy map. Dimensions 1-3 (target audience, problem solving, value proposition) address the first two questions. Dimensions 4-6 (differentiation, channel, monetization) together address "how will you measure success"—because success requires reaching users, differentiating from alternatives, and generating sustainable revenue.

**Audience Choice Cascades Through All Dimensions**

The Medium vs Substack case study demonstrates that changing your target audience forces changes across all other dimensions. Medium chose readers, so their value prop was discovery, their channel was SEO/social for content, their monetization was bundled subscriptions. Substack chose writers, so their value prop was independence, their channel was paying writers who brought audiences, their monetization was enabling direct creator payments. Same technology, different strategies, different outcomes.

**Strategy as Hypothesis Enables Action**

If strategy is a hypothesis, then execution is testing. The scientific method framework means you don't need certainty before acting—you need a clear enough hypothesis to design a test. The one-way/two-way door distinction clarifies how much validation each test warrants. The "smallest thing" principle ensures tests are efficient. Together, these ideas combat analysis paralysis while maintaining intellectual rigor.

**Vision Narrative Makes Strategy Actionable**

A strategy map is analytical; a vision narrative is emotional. The story structure translates strategic dimensions into something memorable and compelling. Because people don't read, the narrative form (especially in video or prototype form) becomes the practical vehicle for alignment. Repetition ensures the narrative persists in organizational memory.

**Leverage is the Meta-Theme**

All these frameworks exist to create leverage. PMs are stretched across infinite demands. The three questions clarify where to focus. The strategy map ensures nothing important is ignored. The hypothesis framing enables faster learning. The vision narrative does alignment work more efficiently than meetings. Every tool serves leverage.

## Action Items

### Immediate

- [ ] **Audit your current strategy clarity**: Can you state who you're solving for, what problem, and how you measure success in one sentence each? If not, that's your first task.
- [ ] **Identify your audience bull's eye**: Write out TAM → narrowed → core. Is your product actually designed for the core?
- [ ] **List your strategic assumptions as hypotheses**: For each dimension, what are you assuming that could be wrong?

### Short-term

- [ ] **Create a 1-2 slide strategy summary**: Something you can share in any meeting to refresh alignment
- [ ] **Build a vision narrative**: Translate your strategy into story form with customer as protagonist
- [ ] **Identify your riskiest hypothesis**: Design the smallest test that would validate or invalidate it
- [ ] **Review your channels**: What percentage of acquisition depends on each? What happens if your primary channel degrades?

### Strategic

- [ ] **Schedule annual strategy review**: Block time for deep-dive on all six dimensions
- [ ] **Build quarterly strategy refresh into planning cadence**: Don't assume people remember
- [ ] **Develop multi-modal communication**: Create video/prototype versions of key strategy content
- [ ] **Map your competitors on the strategy dimensions**: Where are you truly differentiated?

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

**What This Session Doesn't Cover:**
- How to choose between target audiences when multiple are viable
- Specific techniques for market sizing the bull's eye
- How to handle B2B complexity (economic buyer vs end user)
- Details of monetization strategy (pricing, packaging, value metrics)
- How to run effective customer validation interviews
- Cross-functional collaboration mechanics

**Potential Biases in the Material:**
- Heavy consumer/prosumer focus (Medium, Substack, Twitter experience)
- US/English-language market perspective
- Implicit assumption of venture-scale ambitions
- Retrospective case study (we know how Medium vs Substack played out; decisions were harder in real-time)

**Questions for Further Exploration:**
- How do you balance serving current users vs expanding to new audiences?
- When should you pivot your target audience vs double down?
- How do enterprise B2B companies apply the bull's eye when they have complex buying committees?
- How do you maintain strategy discipline when leadership pushes opportunistic pivots?
