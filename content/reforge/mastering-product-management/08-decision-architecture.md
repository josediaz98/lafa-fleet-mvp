Intro to Decision Architecture

The last seven modules have focused on different tools and practices you can use to increase your leverage as a PM.

These tools allow you to generate outsized impact with similar perceived effort.

In this module, we will help you create leverage by becoming a better designer of your team’s decision-making processes. In other words, we will focus not on how to optimize your individual decision-making, but on how to become a better “decision architect.”

PMs are constantly under pressure to make or facilitate consequential decisions involving many stakeholders.

These decisions include issues like:

Which design variation should we use?

What is in scope for the upcoming feature?

Should we change the pricing of our product?

Should we prioritize a newly-emerged partnership?

Should we launch this feature based on its A/B test?

Should we sunset a feature?

In this module, we’ll consider decisions as the choice between multiple courses of action to solve a given problem.

You're probably familiar with one or more of the many decision-making processes and frameworks that are out there. They boil decision-making down into a series of steps that can be categorized into two broad stages. For our purposes, we’ll think of these stages as a loop.

First, you have the pre-decision stage. This includes activities like:

Defining the problem.

Defining the objective and or criteria.

Identifying alternatives.

Evaluating the alternatives.

Discussing and debating the decision, and more.

Next, you have the post-decision stage, which makes the process a loop. This includes communicating, evaluating, and learning from the decisions over time.

Even though PMs tend to be strong analytical thinkers, they can oscillate between a variety of feelings while making decisions.

For example, it’s common to think things like:

“I feel like I’m shooting from the hip and making decisions too quickly.”

“I want to collect input, but I don’t know if I’m collecting the right input or enough input.”

“I feel like there are too many cooks in the kitchen while trying to make this decision.”

“Every decision feels like it takes forever to execute.”

PMs tend to feel conflicted because they may often feel like they’re in a position where they need to choose between two sub-optimal options.

The first option is: making slow decisions that leverage the input of a variety of stakeholders. This involves consulting all relevant stakeholders and negotiating a suitable answer. Not only is this approach slow, it often leads to consensus-driven decision-making, which doesn’t result in the best decisions.

The second option is: making fast decisions with minimal input. In an effort to speed up decisions, some PMs try to make decisions with limited input from important stakeholders.

They’ll prioritize running through red tape in order to avoid slowdowns. While this accelerates the decision-making process, it also results in poor decisions that rely largely on a single person’s judgment. It can cause the team to feel as though their opinions are not valued.

PMs often feel they have to choose one of these approaches, or that they are forced into a specific approach based on the way their company operates.

A PM at a large company may feel like slow, consensus-based decisions are inevitable. This can easily lead to frustration and a desire to work for a smaller company where decisions can be made faster.

Alternatively, a PM at a startup may feel overwhelmed by the endless stream of fast decisions, and feel like they don’t have time to gather the input needed to make high-quality decisions.

This is often a false choice. An effective decision-making process enables you to both make higher-quality decisions involving the right stakeholders, and to make those decisions faster when appropriate.

When PMs struggle with this false choice, there can be major repercussions across the team.

The team wonders whether the decisions are hastily made without taking into account all relevant information.

The team doesn’t feel as if they understand how decisions are made and may even believe the team suffers from HiPPO (highest paid person’s opinion) decision-making.

They ultimately may not trust in the PMs ability to make the right call.

There are three primary challenges PMs face when it comes to making both better and faster decisions in a complex environment.

The first is determining the appropriate level of investment of time and resources for different types of decisions.

In general, PMs tend to over-invest in decisions that have a relatively low-impact on the business, and under-invest in many of the most critical product decisions that have high-impact potential.

The second is knowing the appropriate stakeholders to involve in the decision-making process, and how to best involve them.

There are many stakeholder involvement frameworks out there, including common ones like RACI and RAPID.

However, these frameworks can be heavyweight, and not specific to the product context. As a result, they are often not useful for the context in which PMs make decisions.

The last challenge PMs face is not investing enough to complete the decision loop, and as a result, they are unable to maximize their learning.

Too often, PMs lack the systems to effectively document, communicate, and revisit decisions. This leads to a lack of confidence in the decision-making process and minimizes the potential for learning.

Research on business decision-making supports the idea that where managers go wrong is not in their lack of rigorous analysis, but in their lack of a rigorous process.

This is supported by research conducted by Dan Lovall, a professor at the University of Sydney, and Olivier Sibony, a director at McKinsey & Company. Over five years they studied more than 1,000 “major” business decisions.

They not only looked at the analysis, they also asked executives about the process used to make decisions.

After comparing the results, they determined that process mattered more than analysis—by a factor of six. This isn’t to say that analysis is unimportant, but great analysis backed by poor process is useless.

Therefore, this module is not focused on directly improving your judgement or decision-making logic. Instead, it is focused on the decision-making processes and habits that the best PMs utilize.

As a natural byproduct, the quality of your decisions will inevitably improve.

As you may have noticed, decision-making has been both directly and indirectly embedded within the previous modules. The focus has primarily been on improving your decision-making judgment in ways that create leverage.

For example, the product strategy and product vision modules provide guidance on how to make major complex decisions to guide product direction.

Some modules have focused on helping you develop clarity that empowers effective decision-making. In the case of OKRs, product specs, and your product vision, this means putting in the work to make decisions that will remove dozens, if not hundreds, of decisions in the future.

Finally, some modules provided guidance on developing core systems that improve your product intuition and long-term decision-making (for instance, feedback rivers, lever dashboards, and OKRs).

But these only represent a small fraction of the decisions PMs have to make. There is a long tail of decisions that fall outside anything we have previously explored. This module is focused on the entire spectrum of decisions PMs face.

At the core of this module is the idea that being a great PM is not about being the ultimate decider or generator of good ideas. Instead, it is about being an excellent “decision architect.”

Olivier Sibony, in his book, You’re About to Make a Terrible Mistake: How Biases Distort Decision-Making and What You Can Do to Fight Them, writes, “A wise leader, therefore, does not see herself as someone who simply makes sound decisions; because she realizes she can never, on her own, be an optimal decision-maker, she views herself as a decision architect in charge of designing her organization’s decision-making process.”

This module will delve into three themes aimed at helping you become a better decision architect.

The first theme is decision budgets. By classifying decisions into one of four categories, PMs can determine their decision budget—the appropriate amount to invest in each decision. Additionally, these categories provide the foundation for thinking about how to involve the appropriate stakeholders in the decision-making process.

The second theme is decision-making circles. This approach provides a simple framework (Awareness - Alignment - Inclusion) for determining the best way to involve various stakeholders in the decision-making process, depending on the type of decision. It’s a lightweight and flexible model that can be used more frequently and flexibly than many decision-making models.

The third theme is completing the decision loop. The work doesn’t end once a decision is made. Great PMs put in the necessary work to have a committed team, despite potential disagreements, and to maximize their learning over time.

In particular, they:

Have the discipline to document their decisions and the rationale behind those decisions.

Explicitly define how and when decisions will be revisited.

Communicate the decision, the rationale, and the plan for revisiting the decision.

And maximize their decision reps, and their learning from these reps.

Over the next three lessons, we will walk through each of these themes, with the central focus of making you a better decision architect.

Collectively, this module will help you tap into four types of leverage:

Focused effort: through decision budgets, you focus your time and resources on the decisions that matter most.

Team empowerment: by effectively constructing decision circles and sharing clear decision rationales, we are able to involve more people in the decision-making process while ensuring stakeholders are bought in.

Additionally, when you effectively triage the decisions coming your way, you identify opportunities for delegation. When done well, this empowers the broader team to make certain types of decisions with less PM input.

Leadership buy-in: Decision budgets and decision circles give PMs the tools to communicate why they invest a specific amount in a decision. They also help determine how to best involve the right stakeholders. When done well, leadership tends to entrust PMs with greater autonomy and responsibility.

And lastly, Product intuition: By explicitly documenting and sharing decision rationales—as well as being clear about when it’s appropriate to revisit decisions—great PMs are able to  develop their ability to make better decisions in the future.

Let’s jump into the concept of decision budgets.

Determine Your Decision Budget

In the last lesson we discussed the deluge of decisions that PMs face, sort through, and prioritize.

We also discussed the false choice PMs face between making slow decisions with broad input, and fast decisions with limited input.

In this lesson, we cover decision budgeting and provide a simple, actionable framework for differentiating between different types of decisions and determining how best to invest your limited time and resources into each decision.

One of the core challenges PMs face involves sorting through the variety of decisions that come their way, differentiating them, and determining how much time and resources to invest in each.

As a result, many PMs will end up approaching decisions in a relatively uniform way, and default to one side of the false choice we discussed earlier.

They either default to making slow, deliberate decisions with maximum input, or to making fast, reckless decisions with minimum input.

Regardless of which camp a PM falls into, a uniform approach has two guaranteed outcomes:

PMs over-invest in those decisions that have a relatively low-impact.

And PMs under-invest in many of the most critical product decisions that have the potential for particularly large impact on the business.

Additionally, many PMs experience points of tension when the amount of time and resources they invest in decisions differs from what leadership would expect.

Leadership or other stakeholders are likely to lose trust when the answer to, "how thoroughly did you consider this decision," is, "not much.”

That said, leadership may be just as likely to have a diminished feeling of trust in a PM who over-invests in decisions that seem inconsequential.

In contrast, great PMs are able to quickly and effectively classify each decision in a way that helps determine the appropriate approach.

While each decision has its own nuance and complexity, there are some broad categories of decisions that can create clarity and simplicity.

Some great PMs do this through instinct and pattern recognition developed over time; however, let’s look at a framework that is meant to help you systematically categorize your decisions and determine the appropriate level of investment.

We’ll do this by categorizing decisions into four quadrants that help you change your approach based on the quadrant.

There are two variables that will help categorize the decision.

The first is business impact: to what extent does this decision have the potential to impact the value we create for our users and our business?

The second is reversibility: to what extent are we able to change direction after making this decision?

Jeff Bezos is well-known for thinking about decisions in terms of their reversibility. He says,

“Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible—one-way doors—and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation...We can call these Type 1 decisions.”

But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors...Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.”

It’s worth noting that no decision is truly irreversible, but some decisions are particularly costly to undo; these will fall on the irreversible side of the spectrum.

We assess decisions on impact and reversibility; these two factors help you focus on the decisions that matter most and determine where you can best empower the team.

These come together to create a simple matrix that illustrates four categories of decisions.

Let’s look at a few examples of each type of decision.

High-impact, irreversible:

Setting your vision.

Pricing decisions.

And finally, sunsetting a feature or product.

Low-impact, irreversible:

Early infrastructure and architecture decisions before your product has scaled.

Deciding on a new product’s name.

And defining your product’s APIs.

High-impact, reversible:

Deciding which initiatives to prioritize in your roadmap.

Drafting your quarterly OKRs.

Developing and updating your strategy.

Choosing between design variations for a significant portion of the product (e.g., product homepage).

And deciding whether a new partnership or marketing opportunity is worth the effort it takes to reprioritize your roadmap.

Low-impact, reversible:

Prioritizing which customer reported bugs should be fixed and when.

Deciding what scope of functionality is above the line vs below the line for an upcoming feature.

And choosing amongst various designs that your design partner has proposed for a minor feature.

The value in this categorization comes, not from finding where a decision falls within the matrix, but rather from what you do based on the type of decision.

Before we walk through how great PMs approach each of these, let’s take a step back to define what we mean by a decision budget. A decision budget is simply how much you will invest in making a decision. There are two components of this budget, each of which can be considered on a spectrum.

The first component is timing, or how fast the decision should be made. This is partially a factor of urgency and the extent to which other pieces of the product/business are dependent on this decision.

And the second component is cost, or the time and resources you put into making a decision.

Costs encompass categories, including:

Implicit costs. These are existing company resources that come in the form of people’s time. This is the opportunity cost associated with focusing your time, or the team’s time, on specific decisions.

For example, you may conduct a series of user interviews yourself, but this is at the cost of other activities you could be doing.

Additionally, you may seek out the guidance of a senior executive within the company who could serve as a valuable decision advisor, given his/her background.

You may bring together a broad group of ten stakeholders for an hour-long discussion about a decision. However, this has the cost of ten people hours, or the equivalent of a full workday for an individual.

There are also explicit costs. These are out-of-pocket costs that involve making a payment you wouldn’t already make.

For example, you have explicit costs when you use an external company to conduct user research through customer surveys, focus groups, or usability testing.

You also have them when you conduct  internal user research that involves paying for users’ time.

And you have explicit costs when you hire external advisors to provide expertise or guidance.

The decision category helps you determine how to approach the decision in terms of timing and cost.

For instance, one category is: high-impact, irreversible decisions. An example of a high-impact, irreversible decision is a pricing decision for your product.

This has high business impact, given the potential revenue implications, and is relatively irreversible given the broad implications of price changes.

Most PMs already know to heavily invest in these decisions, but the best PMs do something different: they try to find low risk, reversible ways to test their decisions or to maintain their optionality.

With regards to speed, decisions should be made thoughtfully where possible, collecting the right inputs.

When possible, great PMs seek out ways to buy themselves time by making these decisions reversible.

This could include:

Testing out decisions with a subset of users.

Running A/B tests.

Implementing a decision in a specific geography before releasing it more broadly.

And in the case of a pricing change, you could also consider allowing legacy users in at the old pricing model.

When they can't do this, PMs put in an all-out effort to use whatever time they have most effectively to make the best decision possible.

The cost for these decisions is generally high. PMs should look for the best inputs they can get, whether that is from explicit or implicit costs.

Before moving to the next type, these decisions offer an important, and often-overlooked opportunity. Great PMs recognize the stakes and seek out ways to make them more reversible, and to minimize the immediate business impact.

The next category of decisions we want to look at are low-impact, irreversible decisions.

An example of a low-impact, irreversible decision involves early technical infrastructure, or architecture for a product before it has reached scale.

The immediate business impact is often low, yet it is relatively irreversible since many things in the future will be built on top of the technical infrastructure. The irreversibility of these decisions can often result in significant technical debt down the road.

For example, Wufoo, an online form builder, made an early architectural decision to put each customer’s data into their own independent databases.

The team didn’t spend too long on this decision at the time, since it was so early in product maturity.

However, the decision ultimately led to real limitations, as it added significant technical complexity for any cross-team analysis or feature they contemplated building.

This technical debt became a drag on implementing new innovative product experiences.

Since these decisions are low-impact, the best PMs don’t invest too much in carefully analyzing the decision and brainstorming solutions; rather, they focus their investment on finding and implementing existing best practices. This could include leveraging the expertise of senior leaders at the company, researching industry best practices, or simply ensuring you have someone on the team who has successfully solved a similar challenge before.

You ideally want to be able to make a decision at a medium speed that is neither too fast, nor too slow. You want to make a thoughtful decision in spite of pressure to make a quick decision, given the low business impact.

Many people don't recognize the irreversibility of these decisions and just treat them as decisions that should be made fast with minimal investment. Your job as a PM is to recognize the irreversibility and slow down the process to ensure the best decision is reached.

The cost is medium. While these don’t require the same level of investment as high-impact, irreversible decisions, it’s often easy to under-invest in these decisions given the low business impact. Your job as a PM is to recognize the irreversibility and advocate for higher investment than what otherwise might be provided.

The best PMs emphasize that these decisions don’t present an opportunity to invent the future or show off the team’s creativity. Instead, the best decision is often the proven solution that has worked for others in the past.

The next category is high-impact, reversible.

An example of a high-impact, reversible decision is the decision-making that goes into your roadmap or OKRs, which we have discussed in depth in previous modules.

Given the centrality of these decisions, it’s easy to think of these as irreversible decisions; unlike those discussed earlier, you can easily change course mid-quarter if a specific initiative is not working.

The best PMs give these decisions due process given their impact, but since they are reversible, you can afford to invest less in getting an absolutely perfect answer the first time around and invest more in learning and iterating over time.

The speed here is fast.

These are examples of the Type 2 decisions that Jeff Bezos talks about when he says: “Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.”

The cost is medium.

As you saw in the modules covering roadmaps and OKRs, these decisions require focused time and energy from you, your pod, and other stakeholders throughout the company. However, the investment of resources and time is lower than what is required for high-impact, irreversible decisions.

The most common mistake people make with high-impact, reversible decisions is investing too much up front and not enough in the post-decision phase.

Since these decisions are reversible, it's important that you don't simply use the entire decision budget on the initial decision, but instead ensure there are resources in place to conduct post-mortems; you can revisit the decision when new information becomes available.

Having this discipline, and investing in the post-decision stage, enables you to make these decisions more quickly.

The final lesson in this module will go deeper into this topic and discuss how great PMs complete the decision loop.

Let’s look at low-impact, reversible.

An example of low-impact, reversible decisions is bug triage. Bug triage decisions have low business impact, and are reversible since they occur frequently.

The common mistake PMs make is to invest too much into these decisions. For instance, they’ll unnecessarily take part in regularly scheduled bug triage meetings with the engineering team.

The best PMs approach these decisions in one of two ways. First, they delegate. This means they invest just enough to be able to confidently delegate and pull themselves out of the decision-making process.

For example, if you support the team to develop clear principles for bug triage, you can empower your team to make the vast majority of bug triage decisions on their own; you can remove yourself from routine weekly meetings and only be pulled in for particularly complex situations.

The second mistake is when PMs make the decision too quickly. In some cases, it may make sense to explicitly avoid too much input gathering and instead drive to a decision quickly. To mitigate negative impact, ensure there are mechanisms to revisit the decision and re-evaluate over time.

When a PM is working with their designer on a minor piece of a feature and the designer presents a variety of design options for a minor experience, it makes sense for the PM and designer to quickly put their heads together and make a quick call, versus gathering input from a variety of sources.

In general, great PMs find ways to minimize their investment in these decisions, delegate them where possible, and make them quickly when delegation is not an option. Speed is fast, and cost is low.

Once you’ve categorized your decision and determined your relative level of investment, you should use your decision budget as a tool to build leadership buy-in.

Otherwise, as previously discussed, you may experience points of tension when the level of investment that goes into making a decision differs from what leadership would expect it to be.

This can lead to:

A loss in trust when the answer to, "how thoroughly was this considered," is, "not much.”

Confusion and a loss of trust in a PM who seems to invest heavily in decisions that seem inconsequential.

There are two ways to get leadership buy-in on your decision budget:

In the early stages of a decision, you can pressure-test your decision budget with leadership.

To do so, you can use questions like:

Do you agree that this is a high-impact, irreversible decision?

Is there anything that makes you think I should not be making this decision at this pace?

Is there anything that makes you think we should be investing more or less in this decision?

After a decision is made, leadership may have questions about the process. This is a great opportunity to explain exactly why you invested the time and resources you did (e.g., because it was high-impact and reversible).

Now that we have laid out the approach to decision budgets across each decision type; let’s look at a common scenario that should push a PM to deliberately think through their decision budget and use it as a communication tool.

Frequently, PMs are faced with a decision as a result of new information emerging. To name a few examples: You receive an urgent email from the VP of product because a specific user is particularly unhappy and vocal.

Or, you encounter an opportunity to integrate with a leading platform given a connection someone has with a leader of that platform.

Or, maybe your CEO gets particularly excited about an opportunity that would push everything else off-track.

Many PMs associate this sort of new information with high-impact decisions.

But, instead, it should be viewed as a trigger to evaluate the appropriate decision budget.

These things are often important to address immediately, but that doesn’t necessarily mean dropping everything and making a rushed decision.

Some PMs may be tempted to put these off until the next quarter and stick to the current plan, while others end up being overly reactive.

Neither extreme is right. It's critical to immediately evaluate the decision and determine your budget for it.

For example, let’s look at the example of receiving an urgent email from your CEO regarding an unhappy user.

The natural response is to gather your pod and potentially others to figure out how to immediately address the issue.

However, this is not the desired approach and is likely not what the CEO wants you to do.

The best way to do this is to start with the question, “Is this new information?”

If it is new information, set up a limited investigation to understand the type of decision you are dealing with. What is the business impact, and is this a reversible decision?

For example, the PM may choose to reach out to the unhappy customer to understand their perspective or ask an engineer to look into what it would take to fix a specific technical issue.

Based on the type of decision you’re facing, you can determine the best approach.

If it is not new information, and you have already deliberately chosen to delay action on the issue until a future quarter, then there is no need to dramatically change course.

Regardless, the best PMs proactively communicate the approach to relevant stakeholders, including the CEO, in this case.

In the next lesson, we will shift our attention to those involved in the decision making process, and how to best involve them. To do so, we will introduce the concept of decision-making circles.

Decision Making Circles

Previously, we discussed the false choice that PMs face between making slow decisions with broad input and fast decisions with limited input.

A major piece of this is how to differentiate between different decisions and determine how much time and resources to invest in each.

However, a component of this false choice is determining who to involve in the decision and how to best involve them. This is a critical piece of being a decision architect.

In this lesson, we will dive into decision-making circles.

When this is done well, PMs create leverage through:

Team empowerment. Great PMs are able to involve the right people in a way that is efficient and keeps all relevant stakeholders empowered and in the loop.

And leadership buy-in.

Being able to efficiently involve stakeholders and build alignment leads to greater trust, autonomy, and responsibility for the PM from leadership.

Most PMs take one of two approaches to involving stakeholders throughout the decision-making process.

First, they work to engage as many stakeholders as possible in order to maximize involvement in the process.

This creates alignment around the ultimate decision. This can also lead to a vicious cycle of inclusion that eventually makes PMs want to close themselves off from important input.

PMs start with good intentions and work to take in the input of all the diverse stakeholders.

As a result, they end up building a product that is the result of multiple compromises.

And, unfortunately the product or feature performs poorly.

The PM stops asking for input given all the compromises that had to be made.

Lastly, PMs end up making future decisions without the right input from stakeholders.

On the other hand, some PMs are exceptionally action-oriented and afraid of making slow, consensus-based decisions. As a result, they do whatever they can to minimize stakeholder involvement that could lead to slow or consensus-based decisions.

While this may work at times it may also lead to decisions that lack the right input from important stakeholders.

Moreover, it tends to lead to the team feeling like their input isn't valued. It also impacts the leadership team's confidence in the PM's ability to make complex cross-functional decisions.

Additionally, many PMs become overly-reliant on a generic decision-making framework, such as RACI or RAPID. They are left trying to fit each stakeholder into a complex hierarchy based on the latest framework they have encountered.

While tools like RACI work well in cases of individual responsibility, PMs operate in very different roles; PMs have team-wide and, in many cases, company-wide responsibility.

Rather than autonomously making a decision and pushing it out, the PM must frame a decision for their team, drive the decision-making process, align everyone to the decision, and execute on that decision across a broad, cross-functional team.

This requires a more flexible model for engaging stakeholders.

Decision-making circles are simple groupings of stakeholders to help you determine how to involve them in a decision. It is a lightweight, yet powerful tool that can be used more frequently and flexibly than traditional stakeholder management models.

Stakeholders can be classified into one of three simple, concentric circles. Let’s walk through each of these circles and look at a sample of stakeholders who may be involved in each. As we will discuss later, the exact people within each circle is fluid and depends on the decision you face.

The first is the inclusion circle. This circle is made up of stakeholders who are integral to the decision and should be seen as partners in the decision-making process.

More than any other group, this is the group of people that you engage with most frequently and proactively throughout. It is the small set of people that need to agree, or at the very least commit, to the ultimate decision.

Examples of stakeholders that often fall within the inclusion circle include: The leaders of your R&D pod (e.g., Product Design Lead, Engineering Lead).

Product leaders (e.g., Group Product Manager, Director of Product, VP of Product).

And other cross-functional leaders (e.g., Marketing Manager, Sales Manager).

In practice, great PMs leverage their inclusion circle by facilitating candid discussion and debate.

Every member's voice should be heard and debated as needed; when there is disagreement, they seek to understand the basis of it.

They choose their words wisely to make any debate about the core ideas, rather than a confrontation of someone’s work or identity.

Perhaps most importantly, they set a tone of, “disagree and commit,” within this circle, which then, ideally, feeds out into every other circle.

They explain that the purpose of any deliberation is to get to a point where everyone is committed to a common path forward, but that doesn't mean everyone will agree on said path. The PM allows space to disagree, but demands that the group commit to the ultimate decision.

Ravi Metha says, "Commitment must be active, not passive. Every stakeholder must do their best to make a decision work, even if they disagree. The problem with lack of commitment is generally not active resistance, but passivity and lack of alignment or support."

The next circle is the alignment circle.

This includes stakeholders whose input is valuable and should be proactively considered. Their alignment is critical.

These include:

The members of your R&D pod (e.g., Product Designer, Engineer).

Product leaders (like Group Product Manager, Director of Product, VP of Product).

Product marketing managers.

Product Marketing Managers.

Other senior leaders (including the CEO for smaller companies).

Other PMs.

People in supporting roles (such as User Researchers, Data Analysts, Test Automation Engineers, Customer Support, etc.).

And other cross-functional leaders (such as UX Design Manager, Engineering Manager, Sales Manager, Marketing Manager, Product Operations Manager).

The way PMs leverage the alignment circle differs from the way they leverage the inclusion circle in a few key ways. The first is ensuring input is gathered, but without the need to satisfy every stakeholder.

Unlike the collaboration within the inclusion circle, engagement of the alignment circle should not include deep debate and negotiation.

Instead, it’s about making sure the team is leveraging the perspective of a broader set of stakeholders.

Similar to the inclusion circle, they also emphasize a tone of, “disagree and commit.”

The next circle is the awareness circle. This includes stakeholders who need to be kept informed of the decision-making process and outcomes.

This circle includes anyone whose work may depend on, or be impacted by, the decision.

In contrast to the previous two circles, great PMs don’t actively seek this circle’s input or alignment, but rather focus solely on keeping them in the loop and making sure they are made aware of decisions.

This includes:

Providing transparency with regards to the decision-making process and timeline.

Asynchronously sharing decision updates and opportunities to provide feedback.

Clearly communicating the end decision.

It’s important to note that these circles are not static; your view of them depends on the type of decision you face.

The stakeholders in each of these circles, and what circles exist for each decision, will depend on the category of decision.

Let’s walk through each decision category from the last lesson and look at how stakeholder-engagement varies.

The first category is high-impact, irreversible. As a reminder, the best PMs invest heavily in the high-impact, irreversible decisions, but they also seek out ways to make them more reversible.

The key idea for these decisions is that you will have a large alignment circle, but you don’t necessarily want a large inclusion circle.

Let’s look at an example. The team has been seeing low engagement on a major feature for 6 months; they have also been receiving regular negative feedback about it. As a result, you are now considering sunsetting the feature.

In this situation, the inclusion circle could include your R&D pod leaders (Design Lead, Engineering Lead) and potentially one or two higher-level product leaders (e.g., Group Product Manager, VP of Product).

The PM leverages this circle intensely to facilitate productive debate. As the decision nears, they don’t get paralyzed by driving toward consensus; rather, they emphasize a culture of “disagree and commit.”

The Alignment circle could include: The rest of the R&D pod, the appropriate Product leaders (e.g., VP of Product), Engineers and Engineering Managers who built the original feature, UX researcher, Customer support manager, and a Product Marketer.

In the example scenario, a sunset decision would likely be included in a product review meeting, in which various senior product leaders, including the VP of Product, will be able to provide their input.

The PM leverages this group by ensuring their inputs are gathered, but doesn’t feel the need to satisfy every stakeholder. As the decision is made, they work to ensure the group is aligned and committed to a path forward, even if there is not a unanimous consensus.

The awareness circle could include: Sales Manager, Product Marketing Manager, Legal Rep, and more.

The PM leverages this group  by keeping this group in the loop and making sure they are made aware of the final decision to sunset or not.

The next category is low-impact, irreversible. As a reminder, the best PMs help ensure sufficient investment goes into low-impact, irreversible decisions. Unlike high-impact, irreversible decisions, they don’t invest heavily in brainstorming and collecting ideas from a variety of stakeholders. Instead, the focus is on leveraging best practices.

The key idea for these decisions is that the inclusion and alignment circles should be kept very small, but you will likely have a large awareness circle.

The inclusion circle should be very small and may include 1-2 expert senior stakeholders that you are engaging (e.g., Engineering Manager, VP of Engineering)

The alignment circle is also small. As a reminder, for these decisions, you are much less interested in collecting ideas and inputs from a broad group. Instead, these ideas will primarily come from collected best practices, and the small group within the inclusion circle.

Finally, the awareness circle should be broad. This allows you to be transparent about the process, share the collected best practices widely, and ask for any major rebuttals. Practically, this can be accomplished through Slack or email.

The next category is high-impact, reversible. As a reminder, the best PMs give these decisions due process given their impact, but make these decisions faster since they are reversible. They also place a greater emphasis on using these decisions to learn and iterate over time.

The key idea for these decisions is: The inclusion circle should be kept small, while the alignment and awareness circles should be large.

The small inclusion circle in this case will often include just your core pod.

However, your alignment circle should be quite large. These decisions will naturally impact more stakeholders, so broad alignment is key.

Finally, your awareness circle will also be large. A key component of this is consistent and regular decision documentation that is easily accessible for the broader company. You want this group to know where they can find information related to high-impact, reversible decisions such as roadmaps and OKRs.

The next category is low-impact, reversible.  As a reminder, The best PMs recognize these low-impact, reversible decisions as an opportunity to delegate and pull themselves out of the decision-making process. As a result, they work to invest in setting up the appropriate processes and principles to do this.

The key idea for these decisions is that, in many circumstances, you can find a way to remove yourself from the inclusion circle, and possibly even the alignment circle.

For decisions where this is not possible, you can encompass the entire inclusion circle and keep a very small alignment circle.

Let’s look at an example, such as helping the team triage bugs.

As we discussed in the last lesson, if you support the team to develop clear principles for bug triage, you can empower them to make bug triage decisions on their own; this allows you to only be pulled in for particularly complex situations.

As a result, you can remove yourself from the weekly bug triage meetings and only serve as a point of escalation.

In this situation, the way you think about decision circles changes. You remove yourself from the inclusion circle and alignment circle and empower others to make more decisions on their own.

You then become part of the awareness circle, with the ability to step in as a point of escalation when needed.

In other cases where delegation is less possible, the PM should seek to make these decisions quickly, and with a simple approach to stakeholder engagement.

Let’s look at the example from the previous lesson. When a PM is working with their designer on a piece of a feature, and the designer presents a variety of design options for a minor experience, it makes sense for the PM and designer to quickly put their heads together; they can make a quick call versus gathering input from a variety of sources.

You minimize the inclusion circle to only yourself and the designer.

You don’t need anyone in your alignment circle.

The awareness circle would likely include your R&D pod and anyone else whose work depends on, or will be impacted by, the decision.

That concludes the lesson on decision circles. Hopefully you can see how this simple model can be used flexibly, and how it complements our our previous discussion on decision budgets.

In the next lesson, we’ll look at how great PMs complete the decision loop.

Completing the Decision Loop

In the last two lessons, we covered how to use decision budgets to systematically determine how much to invest in different types of decisions.

We then discussed how to use decision circles to involve the right stakeholders in the decision-making process.

So far, we have been largely focused on the first stage of the decision loop: pre-decision.

Now we want to shift the focus to the post-decision stage; this includes communication, implementation, and learning to improve future decisions.

In this module we will walk through the ways great PMs complete the decision loop through:

Having the discipline to document their decisions, and the rationale behind those decisions.

Explicitly defining how and when decisions will be revisited.

Communicating the decision, the rationale, and the plan for revisiting the decision.

And, lastly, maximizing decision reps and learning from these reps.

Being a great decision architect entails all of these critical post-decision practices.

When this is done well, PMs learn at a faster rate and use their learnings to drive better product decisions in the future.

In other words, this creates leverage for the PM through improved product intuition.

While every PM understands that the decision process doesn’t stop the moment a decision is reached, most PMs will follow through on decisions in a limited way.

They may:

Share the end decision in an update email.

Or, share during an All Hands meeting.

They may also occasionally reflect on previous decisions and think about what they should do differently in the future.

While this is acceptable in many organizations, it adds up to create an incomplete decision loop.

Decision loops are left incomplete when there is a lack of consistent decision documentation, an unclear plan for how and when decisions will be revisited, limited communication efforts that leave stakeholders unsure about the rationale and the plan to revisit decisions, and ineffective mechanisms for learning from decisions over time.

As a result of an incomplete decision loop, the PM inadvertently minimizes their potential, as well as the team’s potential for learning. Additionally, the team may begin losing confidence in the decision-making process.

In contrast, let’s look at how great PMs complete their decision loops to improve their product intuition.

First, great PMs do two things differently when it comes to documenting their decisions.

They publicly document the decision, the rationale, and any related notes about the decision process. This is valuable for communication purposes and is often written out in an easily-accessible place like the company wiki (e.g., Notion, Confluence).

Privately, they maintain a “decision journal” or a “decision log.” This includes everything that is written on the company wiki, including the rationale, but it may also include other notes and personal reflections from the time the decision was made. We will get more into this later in the lesson.

Second, great PMs explicitly lay out when, and under what circumstances, a decision will be revisited. In other words, they lay out how and when the decision might be changed.

In a previous lesson, we talked about setting the tone to disagree and commit. All too often, leaders who are strong advocates for disagreeing and committing are hesitant or unsure about how decisions should be revisited. They may feel like revisiting decisions goes against the commitment they are asking for.

However, great PMs, and leaders in any area, strike a balance between these two concepts. Once a decision is made, they ask for full commitment, yet they are also thoughtful and deliberate about revisiting decisions and changing them as needed.

After all, asking people to disagree and commit without any understanding of when and how decisions will be revisited is an unfair ask.

There are two questions to consider when determining the plan to revisit a decision. The first question is: Is there a natural date by which we should revisit this decision?

In the case of certain decisions like your roadmap and OKRs, there is a built-in review cadence;  decisions, especially high-impact, irreversible decisions may lack a clear timeframe for revisiting.

The second question is: What types of new information would cause us to revisit this decision?

By defining this upfront, PMs can save themselves, and their teams, countless hours of unnecessary stress and consideration as new information arises over time.

Great PMs don’t have to automatically reconsider their decisions every time they hear about a customer complaint, a major move from a competitor, or anything else that inevitably arises within the world of the product.

Third, great PMs not only communicate the decision, they also communicate the rationale that went into it, and the plan for revisiting the decision.

Too often, individuals in the awareness circle, or even alignment circle, receive the decision communication, but don’t understand the full rationale that went into making it.

Understanding the rationale for decisions and the expected plan to revisit decisions is often critical for people to feel like they can disagree and commit.

Consider the perspective of a Product Marketer who disagrees with a decision. They may be thinking:

“I am disappointed that the team decided not to prioritize a new marketing partnership that I was excited about.

I may be frustrated, but at least I can at least understand the rationale that went into making it.

Even still, I may disagree with that rationale, but at least I know there is a plan for revisiting the decision within six months.

Despite my disagreement, I can commit to the work ahead with the confidence that if I was right about this marketing partnership, we will adjust course in six months, or less.”

This last thought is additionally critical so people know their input was heard and is valued.

Gokul Rajaram, a former leader at Square and a Board Member for a number of leading tech companies, suggests that decisions and their rationale be documented in one page and distributed as widely as possible.

He notes that Square uses an email alias (notes@) to ensure all kinds of decisions and meeting notes can easily be distributed within the company.

While there are many other things that go into great communication, we won’t go any deeper for two reasons: First, you are likely already a strong communicator and have good instincts for communicating decisions.

Additionally, there are many resources out there to improve your communication practices.

Fourth, great PMs rigorously review their decisions and maximize their decision reps over time.

Shane Parrish of Farnam Street notes that, “In most organizations your product is decisions. By and large, your success will be the sum of the decisions you make over your career. The problem is it’s not easy to get better at making decisions.”

We want to close this module, by sharing a way that you can systematically learn from decisions and get more “at bats” in the process.

We brought up decision journals when we talked about documenting decisions, but let's look at how you can use one to maximize your own decision intuition.

In fact, when Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winning psychologist, was asked what single thing investors should do to improve their decision-making, he suggested they start a decision journal.

Decision journals are a powerful tool to help us avoid hindsight bias; this occurs when we look backward in time and see events as more predictable than they were at the time a decision was made.

Taking an honest stock of decisions at the moment they are being made is the only way we can get a clear view of what we were thinking at the time.

The real value in maintaining a decision journal or decision log comes through reflecting back on decisions after multiple months or years. It’s critical that you take time every once in a while to read back on previous decisions and ask yourself:

What was the outcome of this decision?

What would you do differently?

If the decision had a bad outcome:

Was there an oversight or some flaw in the process?

How would you have made the decision differently given the information you had at the time?

If the the decision produced a good outcome:

What was particularly effective about the decision-making process or the rationale that went into the decision?

Was the good outcome a product of luck or of a repeatable, high-quality decision process?

What patterns and biases can I see in my decision-making?

This requires no more than 30-60 minutes a few times a year, but there are few activities that will have a bigger impact on your product intuition.

To further accelerate your learning, there’s an opportunity to accumulate more decision reps that few people take advantage of.

In your career, you only get asked to lead so many projects and make so many decisions. Many of these can take months or years to play out. Great PMs use this time to go far beyond their own immediate projects and decisions.

Matt Greenberg, CTO at Reforge and ex-Credit Karma, focuses on “stealing” as many reps as you can. He says, “I watch decisions other people make and try to make those decisions my own.”

Doing so means thinking about the positionality of those making the decisions.

Let's say the CEO or VP of product is making a major decision about team structure or product strategy. Someday you will likely be facing similar decisions. Rather than sitting idly and observing the decision, there is an opportunity to put yourself in their shoes as the decision-maker. Ask yourself:

Would I make the same decisions?

What would I do instead?

Why is this decision being made?

Although they are not your decisions, you can still track these just as rigorously in your decision journal. Over time, you can seek to understand the reasons decisions are made, deliberately monitor them, and reflect on the outcomes.

By taking time to reflect back on some of these decisions, you can ask the same questions we went through earlier in addition to a few extras:

If my decision had gone into effect, what would have been different?

What would have been better or worse?

What blindspots or biases influenced my thinking or the actual decision?

You can be running 3-5 of these reps and getting double or triple the learning compared to reflecting only on decisions that are currently under your control.

Hopefully these four practices help you more consistently and effectively complete your decision loops and improve your product intuition.

That’s all for this module on decision-making, the eighth and final module in the Mastering Product Management program.

Module Recap: Decision Architecture

In this eighth and final module of Mastering Product Management, we covered how to make better decisions using principles from decision architecture.

There are three primary challenges we solved to help you make both better and faster decisions.

The first was determining the appropriate level of investment of time and resources for different types of decisions.

The second was determining the appropriate stakeholders to involve in the decision-making process, and how to best involve them.

The third was ensuring completion of your decision loops to maximize your learning.

To solve each problem, we introduced three tools.

The first tool was decision budgets. You classified decisions into one of four categories based on their impact and reversibility, which then helped you actively decide how much you should invest in researching that decision.

The second tool was decision-making circles, which classified each decision’s stakeholders into one of three circles based on how critical their input was, helping you decide how much you needed to invest in getting their input.

The last tool is decision loops, or more specifically completing decision loops. We talked about how decisions don’t end once they’re made; you also need to document, communicate, and then learn from them.

Let’s recap each of these tools, starting with decision budgets.

The premise behind decision budgets is that decisions can generally be categorized into one of four categories based on their business impact and reversibility, or how easily you can change your decision once it’s made.

Based on the decision category, you can then have some general rules and best practices around how much time you allow yourself to make the decision.

For example, consider a high-impact, relatively irreversible decision like your product’s pricing.

Since it’s so high-impact and relatively hard to go back on, you can consciously decide upfront these will be the decisions you most heavily invest in.

Heavy investment in these types of decisions is obvious to most PMs, but the best PMs do something different on decision speed: they try to find low risk, reversible ways to test their decisions or to maintain their optionality.

Or for low-impact, irreversible decisions, the general rule is to pull a proven solution off the shelf. Instead of trying to show off the team’s creativity, which is better left to more reversible decisions, the best PMs de-risk these relatively irreversible decisions by simply going with the tried-and-true solution.

Then for high-impact, reversible decisions like roadmap plans, where it significantly impacts the business but can also be relatively easily changed in the future, the best rule of thumb is to heavily invest in getting a good initial answer, but limit the investment. Since the decision is reversible, you can afford to invest less the first time around and more in learning and iterating over time.

And then finally for low-impact, reversible decisions like what bug to work on fixing first, you can either delegate the decision to your team, empowering them to decide themselves, or sharply limit your personal time investment and make a quick call yourself.

Next let’s discuss decision-making circles.

The idea behind decision-making circles is to classify stakeholders for each decision into one of three circles:

The inclusion circle which includes those who are integral to the decision and need to actively agree, or at the very least commit, to your ultimate decision.

The alignment circle includes those whose input is highly valuable but their buy-in is not as crucial as that of members in the inclusion circle.

And, and the awareness circle, for those who need to be kept informed of the ultimate decision.

As you progress outward, each circle requires progressively lower levels of buy-in and alignment, letting you efficiently invest your efforts on only the most critical decision stakeholders.

The stakeholders in each of these circles, and what circles exist for each decision, will depend on the category of decision.

For example, in a high-impact, irreversible decision, your inclusion circle might be just your design and engineering lead, and potentially one or two higher-level product leaders like your Group Product Manager, or VP of Product.

Your alignment circle would be wider, including the rest of the R&D pod, the appropriate Product leaders (e.g., VP of Product), and several other stakeholders.

And finally your awareness circle might include the Sales Manager, the Product Marketing Manager, a Legal Rep, and other stakeholders who are affected, but who shouldn’t affect the decision as much as those in other circles.

Finally, let’s discuss completing the decision loop.

Here, we explained how PMs do four things in their decision loops.

First, they document their decisions. They publicly write out the decision and rationale, and also track it in their private decision journal for future reflection.

Second, great PMs explicitly lay out when, and under what circumstances, a decision will be revisited.

This enables people to feel comfortable with disagreeing and committing—because they know the decision will be reflected on, and adjusted later, if found to be ineffective.

Third, great PMs not only communicate the decision, they also communicate the rationale that went into it and the plan for revisiting the decision.

Too often, individuals in the awareness, or even alignment circle, receive the decision communication, but don’t understand the full rationale that went into making it.

Fourth, great PMs rigorously review their decisions and maximize their decision reps over time.

They do this by keeping track of key decisions in a decision journal, and making sure to follow up on those decisions with reflections on the decision’s outcome.

They ask themselves reflection questions like—What patterns and biases can I see in my decision-making—which helps them become better decision makers in the future.

Additionally, they watch and reflect on, not just their decisions, but also decisions other people make, enabling them to accelerate the amount of learning they get.

You now have an overview of the decision-making component of mastering product management.
