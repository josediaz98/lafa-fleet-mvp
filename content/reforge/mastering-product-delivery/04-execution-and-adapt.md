## Executive Summary

Large-scale product development requires a fundamentally different approach than feature work or growth experiments. The shift from building features to launching major products is analogous to transitioning from a speedboat to a large ship—both need speed, but operating them requires vastly different systems.

The core challenge is alignment at scale. Using the Vector Math of Teams framework, individuals are vectors with both magnitude (impact) and direction (focus). True alignment occurs when vectors point in the same direction AND their magnitudes become additive. This requires both **strategic alignment** (are we pointed at the right destination?) and **execution alignment** (are we leveraging each other effectively?).

The execution and adaptation system has four components: **Kick-Off** builds initial strategic alignment; **Product Reviews** maintain strategic alignment throughout development; **Dependency Team Touchpoints** and **Functional Team Touchpoints** build execution alignment. Together, these enable a three-step information loop: verify state → make decisions → communicate, which cycles continuously throughout development.

The most painful failure mode is the **late-stage blow-up**—when a critical stakeholder intervenes late in development and redirects the effort dramatically. This builds resentment, erodes trust, and wastes months of work. Prevention comes through early alignment (Kick-Off) and continuous calibration (Product Reviews), not through avoiding executive involvement.

## 1. The Alignment Imperative

### The Speedboat-to-Ship Transition

The shift to executing large-scale project work is like transitioning from a speedboat to a large ship.

**Speedboat characteristics:**
- Direct control over almost all variables
- Quick maneuvering and direction changes
- Unknown risks appear quickly, enabling easy adaptation
- Destinations are close to shore

**Ship characteristics:**
- Requires an entire crew operating in harmony
- Big redirections happen in small incremental shifts
- New information requires crew identification, timely sharing, and leader recognition of when to intervene
- Destinations are loftier and harder to reach

> Matt Greenberg: "Developing innovative products at scale would be super easy if it was one human working with a million robots. The robots would all be aligned on what to do, how, and when. They'd stay motivated and compliant. All companies would launch big new things all the time. But one of the main reasons why this is hard is because we all work with groups of humans."

> "As we all know, humans are very difficult creatures, with their own ideas, goals, energy levels, and perspectives. The more humans you're working with, the more important it is to build strong alignment to get big things done."

### Vector Math of Teams Framework

This framework comes from Dharmesh Shah and Elon Musk.

> Elon Musk: "Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors."

**Key principles:**
- People on any given team are vectors with **magnitude** (level of impact, scale 1-10) and **direction** (what destination they're aiming for)
- When vectors link together and point in the same direction, their magnitudes are additive
- When vectors have any variation in direction, they detract from one another
- When vectors point in opposite directions, total impact is zero

> Matt Greenberg: "These vectors all exist in a space, with all the possible directions your product or company could go in that space. In order to build alignment effectively, you need to describe the destination clearly, so people can find the path that directs their efforts entirely towards that destination. The clearer your description, the easier it will be for all your people to find the path that gets them there."

**Common misalignment patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Opposite directions | People trying to accomplish fundamentally different objectives | Some believe you should refine existing product, not build new |
| Slightly different directions | Many teams moving in loosely related but unaligned directions | Credit Karma personalization: multiple teams built portions independently |
| Parallel vectors | Same direction but not collaborating; not additive | Teams aligned on what/how but not leveraging each other |

> Andy Johns: "It's very common to have strong dissent amongst the biggest ideas. People have their own visions for where the company should go and pet projects to promote, so it's critical to recognize dissent and have a plan to build alignment."

**Wealthfront example:** In 2015, they attempted to redesign the main dashboard without strategic alignment on the new feature set. The team worked for months cobbling together a Frankenstein solution that was so low-quality they threw it away without ever putting it in customers' hands.

### True Alignment: Two Components

| Component | Question | When Missing |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Strategic Alignment** | Are our vectors pointed in the right direction? | Material components get reworked or scrapped late; stakeholders lack clarity on what/why |
| **Execution Alignment** | Are our magnitudes additive? | Teams unclear on leveraging each other; "I didn't know you needed this" or "I thought I had another week" |

**True alignment enables the Information at Scale Loop:**
1. **Uncovering new information**: Core team members, dependency teams, and execs communicate emerging risks, new learnings, and shifting priorities early and often
2. **Making decisions to adapt**: The core team can make thoughtful decisions quickly
3. **Communicating decisions, implications, and next steps**: Right channels are in place to re-align stakeholders, which provides new information, restarting the cycle

---

## 2. Preventing Late-Stage Blow-Ups

### What is a Late-Stage Blow-Up?

A late-stage blow-up occurs when a critical stakeholder intervenes and redirects a product development effort in a big way, resulting in significant rework and plan changes. It typically happens in late stages because key stakeholders often require seeing and reviewing products before delivery to customers.

> Andy Johns: "When late-stage blow-ups happen, it's devastating to the team, the company, and your customers. The blow-up requires you to stop what you're doing, scrap a ton of work, and reassess what to do next to align with the direction the team has been given."

### Why Late-Stage Blow-Ups Happen

As companies scale, execs become abstracted away from daily execution. They can afford to execute more projects in parallel, becoming meaningfully detached from what's being built, how, and even why. But as leaders, they remain heavily invested and inject themselves at the finish line to ensure alignment with their vision.

The likelihood of disconnection between core team work and exec expectations is high because:
1. Execs are abstracted away from the work being done
2. They didn't align together at the very beginning
3. The misalignment comes from failing to get the right feedback from the right people early enough

### Consequences of Late-Stage Blow-Ups

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Builds resentment** | No one likes throwing out months of work |
| **Creates distrust** | Execs question judgment, ask for more visibility; trust is very hard to regain |
| **Lost time and opportunity cost** | Development halts, deliverables get scrapped, launch delays, roadmap delays |

**Wealthfront example:** When Andy started as Head of Product, the team had frequent late-stage blow-ups on large-scale initiatives.

> Andy Johns: "These blow-ups created nightmares in our development processes, but also, more importantly, were eroding morale on the team and delaying the amount of new value we could give to our customers."

One particularly painful example: working on a redesign to modernize the app, improve UX, and set the stage for new products. After nearly two quarters of grinding through feedback, execs shot down the prototypes and the entire project was scrapped.

### Prevention Strategy

| Process | Purpose | Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Kick-Off** | Build strategic alignment | Get vectors pointed in the right direction from the beginning |
| **Product Reviews** | Maintain strategic alignment | Re-assess direction at regular cadence |

> Matt Greenberg: "If a team is building the right thing, but they say something is 12 weeks of work and it's actually 16, then it's not the end of the world. However, if the opposite is true, and they estimated correctly but what they are building isn't aligned with the vision for the company, then the implications are pretty disastrous."

> Matt Greenberg: "A 10% difference in assumption matters at the beginning. Everyone goes off to make hundreds of decisions after that point based on slightly different rubrics."

> Andy Johns: "Product Reviews are the most effective process I've used on my teams to create opportunities for strategic coaching and improve the product development process over time. When run well, it's where execs 'go to school' to learn how to lead through teaching, and where engineering, product, and design leaders 'go to school' on what it means to think strategically about what needs to be built."

## 3. Building Strategic Alignment: Kick-Off

### Purpose and Structure

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Objective** | Build strategic alignment by driving cross-functional and cross-level buy-in on strategic objectives, prior to development |
| **Audience** | Core team execs, core team members, dependency teams |
| **Format** | Live meeting, 45-60 minutes |
| **Outcome** | Everyone leaves understanding why, what, and how |

> Andy Johns: "At Wealthfront, Kick-Off is where we started our product development process, because the single largest development problem we were experiencing was that product teams would get to the tail end of development and then execs would come in and blow the thing up."

### Why Teams Skip Kick-Off (and Why They Shouldn't)

**Common reasons for skipping:**
- "Everyone signed off on the delivery plan and prototypes"
- Steep timeline pressure to get started immediately
- Perceiving kick-off as executive oversight; wanting to "protect" their work

**Symptoms that indicate you need kick-off:**
- Team is misaligned on what you're accomplishing and why
- False starts—getting started but needing more direction immediately
- Death by 1000 cuts from stakeholder input
- Dependency teams failing to deliver support they agreed to provide

> Matt Greenberg: "An ineffective kickoff can feel like an orchestrated show with minimal participation. But a great kickoff can be a lever for making sure the team is bought in and knows how the success ties together."

### Kick-Off Content Structure

**Three core questions to answer:**

| Question | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Why?** | Customer Value + Business Impact |
| **What?** | Prototype walkthrough |
| **How?** | Delivery plan overview |

#### The "Why" Story: Customer Value

> Andy Johns: "A strong understanding of who you're building for and what problem you're trying to solve for them is the first step to ensuring the team will be aligned on the next 100 decisions after Kick-Off."

**Three components:**

1. **Ideal Customer Profile**
   - Who is the customer/user?
   - What are their needs and wants?
   - What is the magnitude of need?
   - What research informed this profile?

2. **Current Alternative**
   - How have they tried to solve the problem?
   - Why are those solutions inadequate?
   - How do we know this is high-value to solve?

3. **Future Solution**
   - What could the solution look like?
   - What are the key pillars of the product experience?
   - What are anticipated moments of delight?
   - What does their life look like now that we've solved their problem?

**Best practices:**
- Description should be specific and concise (demographic + psychographic)
- Clear who the customer IS and IS NOT
- Accompany with insights from customer research
- Communicate from customer's perspective, not personal interpretation

**Industry examples:**
- **Amazon**: Start with mock press release describing benefits before code is written
- **Airbnb**: "7-Star Review" - describe exceptional customer experience and how they would review it

#### The "Why" Story: Business Value

**Four components:**

1. **Why you'll win**
   - Why is your company best positioned to solve this?
   - Unique assets enabling higher quality or more cost-effective solution?
   - Why now? (Customer sentiment shift, market positioning, new technology, regulatory changes)

2. **Potential impact if you win**
   - Impact on profitability, revenue, or user growth
   - Stretch goal for wild success
   - Performance level that would indicate failure

3. **Critical levers that create impact**
   - Key assumptions from business value lo-fi model
   - How were assumptions selected and informed?
   - What if key assumptions are incorrect?
   - Which growth metrics will be impacted? (Acquisition, retention, engagement, monetization)
   - How must the product be developed to support these assumptions?

4. **Impact to other metrics/areas**
   - What else could be impacted if this is effective?

> Matt Greenberg: "It's important to contextualize impact metrics like these before you start the development effort. Otherwise, it's too easy to explain poor performance away post-launch."

**Twitter homepage example:** During Kick-Off, they mentioned the change might impact search volume, but the tradeoff was worth it for more logged-in users. Result: 1% decline in search volume but 5% increase in signups and 7% increase in logins. Because execs had already considered these tradeoff metrics, it was still considered a success.

#### Development Themes

Reinforcement themes synthesize the most important principles for stakeholders to remember throughout development.

**Credit Karma Savings themes:**
1. 4-click sign-up experience
2. Industry best interest rates
3. Smooth integration with other Credit Karma experiences

> Matt Greenberg: "A great 'why' story is well synthesized, with clear and concise language that's easy to repeat. It highlights themes, and these themes aid in memory and recall for teams as they try to keep alignment and make their own decisions."

#### Prototype Walkthrough

**Framing principles:**
- Emphasize this is an early-stage version; most demos end up looking extremely different
- Specify what type of feedback you're looking for at this stage
- Low or medium fidelity visual designs will suffice; goal is strategic feedback, not precise implementation approval

#### Delivery Plan Overview

Four key points:

| Point | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Important dates** | Critical dates and milestones; what progress should be visible by those dates |
| **Roles and responsibilities** | Who is responsible for what parts of the delivery plan |
| **Decisions made** | Tradeoff decisions made to adjust for scope, time, resources; alternatives considered |
| **Critical risks** | Potential risks to flag early; opportunity to ask for resources to mitigate |

#### Discussion and Q&A

Kick-offs that only land "why" are inspirational but not actionable. Kick-offs that only land "how" lack purpose.

**Close with time for stakeholders to:**
- Ask questions for clarity
- Share feedback on gaps or improvements
- Voice what's exciting or concerning

**Ice-breaker prompts if group is silent:**
- What resonates?
- What feels missing?
- What excites you about this new product?
- What is a cause for concern for you?

> Matt Greenberg: "It's always preferable to have to do some rework early on, rather than realizing you spent months in development on something that's a waste of time."

### Supporting the Why Story with Insight

> Andy Johns: "I like to think about new product development like you're an internal venture capitalist. After all, if you ask for a handful of people to work on a project for a few months, you're effectively asking for a pre-seed round of financing from the leadership of the company. Any entrepreneur who's gone through the early stage fundraising journey would know that the art of the story is what matters in communicating these points."

> Matt Greenberg: "The audience of a kick-off is one of the most diverse groups that you interact with during the lifecycle of a project. Each person is coming in fresh with different priorities and preconceived notions of what you're doing, and you have to balance that in one message."

> Andy Johns: "Kick-off can be the first time that founders or execs are seeing the insight driving new product conviction. They might be aware that research is happening, but often what you learn during the research phase of building conviction is quite different from the preconceived opinions of the leaders of the company, and that contrast is challenging to navigate."

#### Insight Impact Spectrum

| Impact Level | Format Type | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **High** | Interactive, experiential, dynamic | Interview clips, interactive activities, live customer panels |
| **Medium** | Passively consumed but enables conclusion-drawing | Data visualizations, graphs, charts, raw feedback, customer quotes |
| **Low** | Static, passive, delivers insight directly | Tables with data/stats, industry report snippets, satisfaction scores |

#### Determining Right Impact Level

Two assessments:

1. **Expected level of surprise**: Delta between stakeholder beliefs and your insight
2. **Degree of similarity**: How similar/different are stakeholders from target users?

> Matt Greenberg: "It's not hard to communicate market insights if they're exactly what we think they're going to be. It's also not hard to communicate market insights if you work at a company where the team is really interested in hearing market insights that are counterintuitive or surprising. But, if the insights are not intuitive, and your stakeholders aren't open to being surprised by new information, then it's very hard to communicate those things directly and you need a more impactful approach."

**2x2 Matrix:**

| | Intuitive (Not Surprising) | Counterintuitive (Surprising) |
|---|---|---|
| **Similar to user** | Low impact (tables, stats) | High impact (video, panels) |
| **Different from user** | Medium impact (visualizations, quotes) | Medium impact (visualizations, quotes) |

When insight is really surprising AND audience is similar to user: need high impact because people prefer holding existing beliefs and what you're introducing breaks their understanding on a personal level.

**Credit Karma Auto Loans example:**

The insight: Even as credit scores improve, many users don't get better auto loan rates at dealerships due to information asymmetry.

Assessment:
- Counterintuitive to stakeholders ("Why wouldn't rates get better as credit improves?")
- Stakeholders are very different from target user (high credit their whole adult lives, never needed to negotiate)

Solution: Medium impact format—scatterplot with credit scores on X axis, rates on Y axis.

> Matt Greenberg [on the goal]: "One of the best outcomes from a kick-off is when after you take people through the why story, everyone in the room starts nodding their head and comes to the same conclusion—we need to build this product." [He calls this an "And Therefore moment."]

#### Stakeholder Influence Map Process

**Step 1: Stakeholder Assessment**
- List all stakeholders attending kick-off
- Assess baseline understanding (what they currently know/believe about customer, problems, severity)
- Assess distance from customer (how similar/different are they? Have they experienced the problem?)
- Identify anticipated needs (potential questions, concerns, feedback to prepare for)

**Step 2: Insights Plan**
- Identify which component of kick-off will have most friction
- Determine level of impact needed (high/medium/low)
- Note specific insights to bring (interviews, quotes, analyses)
- Decide how to communicate (video clip vs. summary of quotes, etc.)

## 4. Maintaining Strategic Alignment: Product Reviews

### Purpose and Structure

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Objective** | Maintain strategic alignment: facilitate real-time feedback on interim outputs, escalate needs, resolve open questions |
| **Audience** | Exec team and core team (sometimes core team members and dependency teams) |
| **Format** | Live meeting, 45-60 minutes |
| **Outcome** | Exec team provides feedback and coaching on strategic direction as product is developed |

### Why Product Reviews Are Essential

Without recurring touchpoints, expectations from exec teams and reality of what's being built diverge over time. This divergence stems from both sides:

**Core team drift:** Subtly moving in different directions as they get into details, make decisions, learn new information

**Exec team drift:** Subtly diverging as company shifts strategy based on conversations with advisors, board, investors, and new market information

> Andy Johns: "At the highest level, product reviews should minimize the ongoing divergence of expectations and reality to keep everyone on the same page. The lower the ongoing divergence, the less likely a late-stage blow-up will occur."

### Why Teams Avoid Product Reviews

> Andy Johns: "I was once actively trying to hire someone for a Head of Product role, and when they heard that part of the job expectations was running effective Product Reviews, they immediately backed out because they didn't want the oversight. They had a prior CEO that was notorious for late-stage blow-ups, so they didn't want any form of executive involvement in product development."

> "I frequently come across wounded PMs that no longer want the execs involved in the development process because of late-stage blow-ups, but the ironic solution to that problem is a recurring product review."

### Common Product Review Failures

| Failure Mode | What Happens | When Done Well |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Tactical feedback** | Execs focus on pixels when product is in concept stage | Core team focuses discussion on areas relevant for development stage |
| **Critical of team members** | Execs question personal judgment or capabilities | Feedback focuses on teaching and coaching strategic perspective |
| **No decisions made** | Everything goes to offline one-on-ones | Core team brings challenges for resolution, feels empowered |
| **Inefficient input** | Core team wants to "go build in a corner" | Core team values feedback and receives coaching |

### Trust Erosion Patterns

| Pattern | What Happens | When Done Well |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Time not well spent** | Core team comes unprepared, fails to bring meaningful material | Execs see value as opportunity to shape future products |
| **Burying the lede** | Most important info obscured by less important info | Most critical decisions and risks covered first |

**Intuit example of best practices:**
- Dedicated office at headquarters for product reviews (environmental trigger)
- Strict rules of engagement clearly visible in the room
- Strictly managed attendance for safe, intimate environment
- Visual examples on walls of successful products in their development stages

> Andy Johns: "I never want the exec team to question why they're in the meeting. By covering key decisions first, it's clear where their focus needs to be and how they can add value, steering them clear of in-the-weeds details that they likely shouldn't be focusing on."

---

## 5. Designing Product Reviews

### Two Product Review Approaches

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to Product Reviews. All approaches solve for two unique outcomes:

#### Approach 1: Input & Feedback

**Purpose:** Share interim outputs (wireframes, prototypes, demos) with exec audience

**Characteristics:**
- Structure facilitates feedback from exec stakeholders
- Focus feedback on most relevant/impactful areas
- Core team sets context on development stage and expectations/rules of engagement
- Agenda is very light; status updates covered quickly or asynchronously
- Majority of time on "show and tell"

**Vector theory framing:** Points the core team's vector in the same direction as exec team and company priorities. By sharing interim outputs, you can tangibly see if moving in same direction or need to pivot.

#### Approach 2: Resolution & Awareness

**Purpose:** Elevate decisions for exec deliberation; share context on potential risks

**Characteristics:**
- Few demos or interim output reviews
- Core team shares context, decisions needed, options, recommendation, timeline
- Common when major risk manifests or cross-functional priority collisions occur

**Vector theory framing:** Points the exec team's vector in the same direction as the core team. As you learn new information, run into risks, and face challenges that may require redirection, these reviews provide opportunity to elevate, discuss, and decide.

**What to elevate:**
- **Awareness:** Signals that a critical risk in delivery plan is manifesting (e.g., 3rd party partner stops responding)
- **Resolution:** Tradeoffs that occur because of risk manifesting (e.g., cut scope or move back launch?)

> Andy Johns: "Always have a recommendation on what the decision or next steps should be. You have the most context on the problem out of anyone in the review."

> Matt Greenberg: "It's a terrible situation when a risk manifests and an exec says, 'Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this?'"

### Choosing Your Approach

Consider two factors:

#### Factor 1: What Drives Late-Stage Blow-Ups at Your Company?

**If vision divergence (product):**

**Wealthfront example:** Founders would swoop in at finish line and want to change something fundamental. Building Portfolio Analysis tool, received late-stage blowup two weeks from launch. Issues: copy was technical vs. simple, analyzed too many variables vs. focusing on few, transfer encouragement was sales-y vs. non-self-serving.

Solution: Product reviews focused on **Input and Feedback** with "show and tell" moment using prototypes and demos.

**If operational complexities:**

> Matt Greenberg: "I think about reviews as an opportunity to clear the road so my teams can keep moving quickly. I need to use this meeting to resolve the things I can't clear on my own, or for someone to identify the things I don't see so that the team can keep moving really, really fast."

> "If I spent the product review time on getting input on the product, I would get smiling faces, because demos are interesting and exciting. But I would not necessarily get strategic alignment or reduce the likelihood of a late stage blow-up, because the product design rarely caused disruption with our exec team."

Solution: Product reviews focused on **Resolution and Awareness**—context, resolving decisions, mitigating risks.

> Fareed Mosavat: "There are a small number of things that each leader cares about, and each of those things warrants a specific process. If you try to design a process that solves for everything, you end up with something so heavyweight that the product development pace slows to a halt."

#### Factor 2: What Unique Constraints Determine Product Success?

When differentiation depends on single high-quality experience OR business impact is concentrated on seasonal/episodic use case: need more methodical, rigorous process.

**Intuit TurboTax example:**
- Filing taxes is painful, complex, vulnerable, frustrating
- Very high quality bar for customer value; moment of delight anchors on incredible simplicity, requires confidence and trust
- Highly seasonal: tax season once per year, concentrated window (~40% of US returns filed in first week)
- Every meaningful feature must work flawlessly by first week of season

Result: Incredibly structured review process with dedicated office, strict rules of engagement, visual cues reinforcing "good" at each stage.

**Slack example:**
- High-quality, delightful experiences needed, but more frequent use case
- Users bring less inherent frustration to daily communication than tax filing
- Multiple moments of delight in ecosystem
- Recurring subscription revenue, less time pressure on specific release

Result: More frequent and fluid process. Weekly reviews, anyone can sign up or sit in, each lead has flexibility on how to use time. Split process: product reviews with CEO + separate go-to-market reviews for enterprise customers.

---

## 6. Running Effective Product Reviews

### Focusing the Discussion: Feedback Fidelity Fit

One common challenge: getting the right feedback at the right time.

**Problem pattern:**
- Early stages: Need strategic input, but execs react to pixels
- Late stages: Need pixel feedback, but execs offer high-level suggestions that fundamentally change product

**Solution:** Ensure deliverable fidelity matches feedback level needed.

| Fidelity Level | Output Examples | Feedback Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Low** | Wireframes, slides listing key points, planning templates | Reactions to options, strategic input on prioritization |
| **High** | Detailed delivery plans, demos in staging/production, pixel-perfect prototypes | Approval on specific copy, staffing/budget decisions |

**Early stages:** Need low-fidelity feedback → bring low-fidelity deliverable
**Late stages:** Need high-fidelity feedback → bring high-fidelity deliverable

> Fareed Mosavat: "Consider the zoom on a camera. If you want the viewer to focus on the lighting in the landscape, you wouldn't give them a photo zoomed in on the flower. In contrast, if you want the viewer to react to the petals on the flower, you wouldn't show them the whole landscape."

> Matt Greenberg: "Even if you can bring a high-fidelity draft to a high-level discussion, it's not always better to do so. If the team is showing me something that looks final, I don't want them to waste their time rebuilding unless something is terribly wrong. And, it's so hard not to react to the pixels that look off when they're right in front of you."

### Clarifying Feedback: Commands, Suggestions, Ideas

A common problem: unclarified feedback leads to swirling rather than accelerating to solutions.

#### Type 1: Commands

**Definition:** Reacting to a specific problem and describing exactly how to solve it, with expectation you solve it that way.

**Wealthfront Home Savings example:** CEO demanded feature to incorporate equity from existing home into savings plan for next home purchase. Team had excluded it because it added weeks of scope. Directions were clear—required despite monthly-long scope increase.

**Clarify:**
- Gaps in understanding: Do you know exactly what the decision/change should be? Does exec understand tradeoffs?
- Follow-up needed: Do they need to see change before you move forward? Does team have autonomy to act and move on?

#### Type 2: Suggestions

**Definition:** Reacting to a problem and offering perspective on how to solve it, without necessarily expecting exact implementation.

> Matt Greenberg: "I often give suggestions in the phrasing 'if it were me, I would…' When I do this, I'm expecting teams to use their judgment if they have a strong perspective, but offering mine if they don't."

**Credit Karma Savings example:** Matt suggested focusing on one platform instead of splitting front-end resources between web, iOS, and Android. Team disregarded; later needed to add resources and cut one platform to deliver quality on time.

> Matt Greenberg: "Sometimes it swings the other way, but in this case experience had given me the feeling but not the facts on a suggestion, and I expected the team to take it more seriously at the time."

**Clarify:**
- What problem are they reacting to?
- What flexibility exists in how you solve it?
- Why did they choose that suggestion?
- What follow-up is needed? (Just know what choice you made, or review again?)

#### Type 3: Ideas

**Definition:** Sharing perspective without specific problem or expectation of implementation.

**Wealthfront College Savings example:** Co-founder suggested pulling up college logos and showing estimated cost of attendance by child's 18th birthday. Team spent days researching feasibility, found it doable with clever hacks and a week of engineering. Returned excited to implement plus additional self-generated moments of delight.

**Approach:**
- Record ideas and review later as thought starters
- If needed, refocus conversation by respectfully redirecting

### Recording Takeaways

Two methods:
1. Document and share notes
2. Record adjustments in change log

> Matt Greenberg: "The person who takes notes has the power. They shape the narrative of the meeting. They prioritize which follow-ups you revisit. And they determine ownership of next steps."

**Credit Karma practice:** CEO eventually took note-taking role to ensure feedback was 100% clear and in writing. Team always responded with their own notes, calling out differences for clarification.

**Live note-taking strategy:** Demo on one screen, notes on other screen, so everyone sees what's documented as it happens.

> Andy Johns: "Effective documentation from your product reviews ensures that the team is closing the loop on important feedback they receive, which is another tactic to minimize the chance of a late-stage blow-up."

> Matt Greenberg: "I've gone back to the notes or change log more than 100 times. The attributed record of feedback + decisions is often the best source for adjudicating misunderstandings months later."

**Notes should capture:**
- Who is taking notes? Who receives them?
- What were the 2-3 most important things shared?
- What was said? Who said it?
- What actions should be taken?
- How should they be done or what needs to be considered?
- Who should do it?
- By when?

**Change log should capture:**
- Day/Week of decision
- What did we know facing the decision?
- What options/tradeoffs did we consider?
- What decision did we make?
- Additional context for future retrospectives

### Implementing Product Reviews

#### Starting Product Reviews

**Avoid the Pope Method:** A leader not typically involved emerges, announces product reviews, then disappears back into their day-to-day.

**Problems with Pope Method:**
- Execs not engaged; check-the-box activity
- Core team experiences it as oversight, not opportunity

**Instead, position value for each group:**
- **Execs:** Earlier and continuous involvement keeps them plugged into most important aspects as product develops
- **Core team:** Earlier feedback means better product and lower blow-up likelihood
- **Broadly:** Position around customer as final recipient—deliver high-quality products efficiently for their benefit

#### Rules of Engagement

**No multitasking**
Put laptops and phones away. Only laptops: presenter and note taker. If someone is on a device, they may not need to be present.

> Andy Johns: "We would often ask anyone on their laptops to leave the meeting. Unless you're an engineer working on a hot fix or the person giving the demo you do not need your laptop for the product review."

**Focus on customer and business value**
Focus feedback on improving how output/decision will drive customer and business value. If team achieves these, stay out of "how they're doing it."

**Consider the status of development**
Early stages: no discussion about late-stage decisions like copy or roll-out plans.

**Hold your questions until the team is ready**
Helps maintain focused discussion. By waiting, execs often see questions get addressed. Prevents "rabbit hole" effect. Tool: pens and notepads for writing questions to bring up in orderly fashion.

**Limit attendance**
For core team: smaller audience helps focus discussion.
For execs: more room to share critical feedback.

> Matt Greenberg: "We kept the room small also to make the exec team feel comfortable giving their honest perspective. They wouldn't give their most critical feedback if they didn't have comfort with the people in the room."

Best practice: regularly "trim" audience when group grows or certain people rarely contribute. Few companies have more than 30 people in product review.

**Give input to coach and teach**
Done well, reviews ensure more team members build intuition around seeing products through strategic lens of founder/executive. Frustration is counterproductive.

> Andy Johns: "It's like a teacher being mad at you for not getting the concept. If anything, it hurts the student's confidence, making it harder to absorb the concept. Product Reviews provide an equal opportunity for executives to learn how to coach junior employees, and for junior employees to learn how to think about the business like an executive."

**Don't bury the lede**
Get to important points quickly. Prep thoughtfully. Know what's important to execs—what matters most to you may not be what matters most to them.

> Matt Greenberg: "Imagine if the core team focuses the conversation on the timeline, then late in the review brings up a challenge with front end design as an afterthought, and proposes a change that violates the core product vision. This is burying the lede, too, but due to a misaligned understanding of what is most important. Where the team cares most about the timeline, the execs care most about reinforcing product vision."

**Be brief and efficient**
Scheduled, recurring time block. Don't exceed time limit; don't feel pressured to use all scheduled time.

**Common problem:** Wrong length and cadence for development stage. When no critical decisions or outputs, teams cover status updates that should be asynchronous.

**Reality:** Needs evolve over development cycle. Length proportional to number of decisions needed.

| Stage | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Beginning | Many open questions → lengthier reviews |
| Middle | Fewer open questions, team in execution mode → shorten or cancel |
| End | Open questions ramp up (imminent tradeoffs, integration work) → length and frequency increase |

**Prep time should be proportional to meeting duration.** If prep takes longer than meeting:
- **Increase frequency:** May be losing context between sessions, taking too much time to recalibrate
- **Get out of the weeds:** May be bringing something too detailed for exec audience

## 7. Building Execution Alignment: Team Touchpoints

### Functional and Dependency Team Touchpoints

**Functional team touchpoints:** With core team members in your function (e.g., engineering leader with all engineers on development effort)

**Dependency team touchpoints:** With cross-functional owners of outputs in delivery plan (e.g., legal, customer support—less involved in development/design decisions)

### The Information at Scale Loop

When things go right, touchpoints enable a virtuous cycle:

1. **Verify state and uncover new information**
2. **Make decisions to adapt**
3. **Communicate decisions, implications, and next steps** → provides new information → cycle restarts

### Four Common Execution Challenges

| Challenge | Problem | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Touchpoints degrade in quality | Status updates instead of surfacing challenges, risks, outputs | Asynchronous updates + structured live discussions |
| Amorphous problems | Poorly explained, hard to help | Rocks vs. Monkeys framework |
| Leaders struggle with intervention | Unclear when/how to intervene | Intervention Decision Tree |
| Disorganized escalation | Separate escalations without full context | Clean Escalation culture |

### Challenge 1: Touchpoint Degradation

**Problem:** Time is spent on status updates rather than surfacing challenges, risks, and outputs to discuss. Purpose is poorly defined.

> Matt Greenberg: "Often when people don't know what problem the meeting is supposed to solve, or they forget over time, they default to giving updates."

**Why this is problematic:**
- Time is your most valuable resource on large-scale development
- Status updates are superficial signals; on/off-track is high-level and subjective

**Solution - Three practices:**

1. **Send asynchronous status update** with clear trigger for team to update and others to read
2. **Build buffer time**: Ask for updates well in advance; build time to read before meeting (hours before, or first 5 minutes of session)
3. **Structure live updates** to focus on action items and decisions needed

**Agenda structure:**
1. Action items (teams note critical items for upcoming week + notes as needed)
2. Decisions to be made
3. Decision details

### Challenge 2: Amorphous Problems (Rocks vs. Monkeys)

#### Rock Problems (Well-Scoped)

**Definition:** Like moving a rock from A to B—easy to help because the work of figuring out destination and tradeoffs is done.

**Characteristics:**
- Cognitive load of framing the problem is complete
- Context is shared intentionally
- Root cause identified
- Options for solving identified
- Best option considered
- Actionable; team can make progress in touchpoint

> Matt Greenberg: "On my teams we use the principle 'share what matters.' Be concise and intentional about what this audience needs to understand to help solve your problem."

> Andy Johns: "Well scoped problems also clearly lay out the tradeoffs for the group to deliberate on, because they almost always involve a tradeoff across group priorities—especially product, engineering, and design interactions."

**Credit Karma Savings example (Rock):**
Team stuck with difficult dependency partnership. Dependency team stopped collaborating despite work being late and critical.

Instead of saying "Our dependency team isn't collaborating. Please help," the team:
- Shared context on past attempts to solve
- Communicated what help they needed: one-on-one email/meeting between leaders
- Enabled actionable next steps: drafted email for Matt to send

Result: Quick deliberation on approach, immediate next step taken.

#### Monkey Problems (Amorphous)

**Definition:** Like babysitting a monkey for a weekend—where do you even start? What do monkeys eat? Where do they go to the bathroom?

**Characteristics:**
- Chaotic mess
- Unnecessary detail or not enough context
- Lack of control, high stress and drama
- Unclear how to help
- Challenging to discuss in group with limited time

**Credit Karma Savings example (Monkey):**
Team struggling with deadlines. At touchpoint: "We're overwhelmed. Deadlines are completely unrealistic. Requests are unreasonable. Impossible to complete."

Problems:
- Context was scattered and confusing
- Unclear where to focus, what input needed, how to help
- Matt had to ask series of questions to frame potential solutions
- Not actionable; needed follow-up session to decide on tradeoffs

**Solution:** Structure live touchpoints to focus on decisions needed, not discussion.

**Decision structure (for each decision):**
1. **Context:** Grounding information relevant for team audience
2. **Criteria:** What criteria to use for making the decision
3. **Recommendation:** What decision to make

This structure encourages "rock-making" not "monkey-making" by requiring cognitive thinking before bringing problems to discussion.

### Challenge 3: Intervention Struggles

Leaders need to delegate interim outputs to scale, but remain responsible for outcomes while indirectly involved in work.

**Four intervention types:**

| Type | Definition | When to Use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Observe** | Let them figure it out; check back later; make mental note to monitor | High rigor of thought |
| **Direct** | Describe exactly what to do or do it with them | Low rigor + low potential to solve themselves |
| **Coach** | Guide to right answer with questions and feedback | Low rigor + high potential + high learning opportunity |
| **Support** | Give proactive guidance/validation, then let them deliver | Low rigor + high potential + low learning opportunity |

#### Why Intervention is Challenging

1. **Consequences unclear:** Gray area between small consequences and death blows on new large-scale development
2. **Time constraints:** Can't intervene on all problems like you could with smaller efforts
3. **Learning vs. outcomes tension:** Want to build bench for when product is live, but responsible for project success
4. **Varying skill sets:** Step-up opportunities coexist with team members in over their heads

#### The Intervention Decision Tree

**Step 1: Assess rigor of thought**

Ask follow-up questions:
- Who has provided input? Have you chatted with X expert?
- What options have you considered?
- What criteria did you use to decide on approach?
- How does this impact other teams and project as a whole?

**Indicators of rigor:**
- Turned to experts for guidance (not isolation)
- Clearly thought through your question before
- Considered all options; decision is logical
- Can articulate impact on other teams/orgs
- Speaks with conviction and specifics (not uncertainty and vagaries)

**If high rigor → Observe**

**Credit Karma PHP migration example (Observe):**
Team pushed micro-services philosophy too far, creating too many services. When Matt asked follow-up, they had strong rigor and held tight to their opinion.

> Matt Greenberg: "Though my experience told me that their approach was a mistake, I also knew that the cost to the company was reasonably low and they would eventually draw the same conclusion by learning the lesson over time."

Matt observed early, followed up in subsequent meetings and retrospectives, nudging along the way.

**Vector framing of Observe vs. Direct:**
- **Directive:** Abrupt change, quick course correction, but energy/motivation decreases (reduced magnitude)
- **Observe:** Slow course correction over time, but they navigated on their own (maintains magnitude)

> Matt Greenberg: "Allowing teams to bring their best work to a solution they believe in wholeheartedly but takes them slightly off course is okay, because they'll travel further on the thing they believe in than the directive you give them."

**Step 2 (if low rigor): Assess potential to solve themselves**

**If low potential → Direct**

**Wealthfront latency example (Direct):**
CTO directed financial planning team to stop new feature development and focus on scalability and latency. Infrastructure had been ignored—product getting slower, eroding experience quality. CTO had prior experience with scale/latency challenges; first-time engineering leads did not.

> Andy Johns: "Sometimes people don't have the skillset or capability to solve the problem, and no amount of coaching will get them there. Once they observe the results of the decision, they'll appreciate why the decision was made to inform other learnings."

**If high potential → Coach or Support**

**Step 3 (if high potential): Assess learning opportunity**

**If high learning opportunity → Coach**

**Credit Karma UK example (Coach):**
Team hit roadblocks with other teams on GDPR updates. Got increasingly frustrated, bringing poorly scoped "monkey problems"—shift from earlier when they brought "rock problems." Matt knew they could do better because they had done better.

Problem scoping was essential skill for them to advance as leaders. Matt coached: asked open questions to uncover context, consider tradeoffs, understand implications, come to sound decisions.

Over time, group shifted: took more ownership of scoping problems independently, processes improved.

**If low learning opportunity → Support**

Give proactive guidance and context to redirect efforts, but don't get directly involved as with coaching.

### Challenge 4: Disorganized Escalation

**Problem:** Individuals separately escalate to respective managers/execs without full context.

**Consequences:**
- Misinformation and poor decision making (leaders lack full context)
- Erosion of trust between team members; erosion of morale
- Erosion of trust from exec team (messy escalations indicate poor partnership)

#### Clean Escalation

**Definition:** Two people or teams in disagreement escalate issues together to a neutral decision maker, ideally after trying to resolve themselves.

**Benefits:**
1. **Better decisions:** Both parties share context for their position; decision maker has all facts
2. **No one caught off guard:** No one goes behind another's back to skip-level
3. **Shifts ownership:** Demonstrates accountability and strong collaboration, earning greater autonomy and trust

**Implementation:**

As product/engineering leader:
- **Refuse to weigh in on disorganized escalations**
- If team escalates problem with another team in isolation, ask to speak with both at same time before making decision
- After clean escalation, support and reward teams that escalate cleanly

> Matt Greenberg: "Over time, teams will appreciate a climate of clean escalations, as it reduces the feeling of politics and drama that can often plague large efforts."

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

### What This Framework Doesn't Address

1. **Remote/distributed team dynamics:** All examples assume co-located or hybrid teams with ability to have dedicated physical spaces and in-person reviews

2. **Very early stage companies:** Framework assumes scaling companies with exec layer and multiple teams; may be overhead for startups with <20 people

3. **Non-product stakeholders:** Limited guidance on managing board members, investors, or external partners in alignment processes

4. **Cultural transformation:** Assumes ability to implement new processes; doesn't address resistance management or change leadership

5. **Tool/technology specifics:** Framework is process-agnostic; doesn't recommend specific project management, documentation, or collaboration tools

6. **Failure recovery:** Focus is on prevention; limited guidance on recovering from a late-stage blow-up that has already occurred

7. **Metrics for success:** No quantitative measures provided for assessing whether alignment processes are working effectively

## Appendix: Key Quotes by Theme

### On Alignment

> "Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." — Elon Musk

> "Developing innovative products at scale would be super easy if it was one human working with a million robots... But one of the main reasons why this is hard is because we all work with groups of humans." — Matt Greenberg

> "It's very common to have strong dissent amongst the biggest ideas. People have their own visions for where the company should go and pet projects to promote, so it's critical to recognize dissent and have a plan to build alignment." — Andy Johns

### On Late-Stage Blow-Ups

> "When late-stage blow-ups happen, it's devastating to the team, the company, and your customers." — Andy Johns

> "If a team is building the right thing, but they say something is 12 weeks of work and it's actually 16, then it's not the end of the world. However, if the opposite is true, and they estimated correctly but what they are building isn't aligned with the vision for the company, then the implications are pretty disastrous." — Matt Greenberg

> "A 10% difference in assumption matters at the beginning. Everyone goes off to make hundreds of decisions after that point based on slightly different rubrics." — Matt Greenberg

### On Kick-Off

> "At Wealthfront, Kick-Off is where we started our product development process, because the single largest development problem we were experiencing was that product teams would get to the tail end of development and then execs would come in and blow the thing up." — Andy Johns

> "A strong understanding of who you're building for and what problem you're trying to solve for them is the first step to ensuring the team will be aligned on the next 100 decisions after Kick-Off." — Andy Johns

> "A great 'why' story is well synthesized, with clear and concise language that's easy to repeat. It highlights themes, and these themes aid in memory and recall for teams as they try to keep alignment and make their own decisions." — Matt Greenberg

### On Product Reviews

> "Product Reviews are the most effective process I've used on my teams to create opportunities for strategic coaching and improve the product development process over time." — Andy Johns

> "At the highest level, product reviews should minimize the ongoing divergence of expectations and reality to keep everyone on the same page." — Andy Johns

> "I frequently come across wounded PMs that no longer want the execs involved in the development process because of late-stage blow-ups, but the ironic solution to that problem is a recurring product review." — Andy Johns

> "I think about reviews as an opportunity to clear the road so my teams can keep moving quickly." — Matt Greenberg

### On Feedback

> "Consider the zoom on a camera. If you want the viewer to focus on the lighting in the landscape, you wouldn't give them a photo zoomed in on the flower." — Fareed Mosavat

> "The person who takes notes has the power. They shape the narrative of the meeting." — Matt Greenberg

> "I've gone back to the notes or change log more than 100 times. The attributed record of feedback + decisions is often the best source for adjudicating misunderstandings months later." — Matt Greenberg

### On Intervention

> "Allowing teams to bring their best work to a solution they believe in wholeheartedly but takes them slightly off course is okay, because they'll travel further on the thing they believe in than the directive you give them." — Matt Greenberg

> "Sometimes people don't have the skillset or capability to solve the problem, and no amount of coaching will get them there." — Andy Johns

> "On my teams we use the principle 'share what matters.' Be concise and intentional about what this audience needs to understand to help solve your problem." — Matt Greenberg

### On Escalation
