## Executive Summary

Scaling product delivery is fundamentally different from shipping features. When startups are small, they invest heavily in engineering processes—code standards, post-mortems, automated testing—creating robust systems for iterative improvements. Yet these same companies often lack robust systems to deliver their next big innovation, and struggle to develop them. This paradox explains why companies with strong engineering cultures still experience late-stage blow-ups, missed deadlines, and products that underwhelm customers.

The central thesis of this program is that **big bet innovations require systematic approaches that are neither pure Agile nor pure Waterfall**. Agile's short iteration cycles cannot handle "long poles" that span months, external commitments requiring advance planning, or the coordination complexity of multiple dependent teams. Waterfall's detailed upfront planning creates false precision based on assumptions that will inevitably prove wrong. The solution is a "Dynamic Delivery" methodology that captures critical planning details early while building in explicit room to evolve as learning occurs.

The framework consists of four interlocking "pulleys" that make delivering innovative products reliable and repeatable: **Product Conviction** transforms fuzzy product sense into validated understanding through structured customer research, takeaway conversations, and lo-fi business modeling. **Dynamic Delivery Plans** balance structure and flexibility through work breakdown structures, meaningful milestones, and explicit risk mitigation. **Execution & Adaptation** maintains alignment through kick-offs that prevent late-stage blow-ups and product reviews that serve as ongoing calibration mechanisms. **Launch Strategy** maximizes post-development impact through staged rollouts, coordinated runbooks, and clear frameworks for navigating post-launch uncertainty.

The most counterintuitive insight is that **going slow at critical moments enables going fast overall**. Two to three weeks spent building conviction before committing to six to twelve months of development is asymmetrically valuable—the downside is small (delayed start), while the upside is enormous (avoiding months of wasted effort). Similarly, investing in kick-offs and product reviews feels like overhead but actually accelerates delivery by preventing the catastrophic late-stage blow-ups that destroy morale, erode trust, and waste months of work.

The framework addresses a fundamental human challenge: developing innovative products at scale requires coordinating groups of humans who have their own ideas, goals, energy levels, and perspectives. Using the Vector Math of Teams framework, every person is a vector with both magnitude (impact) and direction (focus). True alignment occurs when vectors point in the same direction AND their magnitudes become additive. When vectors diverge even slightly, they detract from one another. This explains why companies with talented individuals still struggle—without systematic alignment mechanisms, individual excellence doesn't compound.

Post-launch, the challenge shifts from building to adapting. Products enter one of four "gears"—Accelerate, Improve, Restart, or Wind Down—each requiring fundamentally different leadership approaches and backlog priorities. The difficulty lies not in the extremes (clear success or failure) but in the ambiguous middle where signals are mixed and the right path forward is unclear. The frameworks in this program provide the vocabulary and decision structures to navigate these transitions deliberately rather than reactively.

## 1. The Delivery System Philosophy

### The Problem: Manual Lifting Stops Working

**Core Concept**

Product development is like lifting boulders. In the early days, when boulders are small and teams are tight-knit, manual effort works. Everyone can see what needs to be done, communication is effortless, and heroic individual contributions can carry the day. But as companies scale, the boulders get larger—customer expectations evolve, growth requires step-change innovations rather than incremental improvements, and the coordination required exceeds what any individual can manage.

The insight is that companies need "pulley systems"—structured frameworks that make delivering innovative products reliable and repeatable, rather than dependent on heroic individual efforts. Just as pulleys multiply force through mechanical advantage, delivery systems multiply organizational capability through systematic approaches.

> "When startups are small, they invest in engineering processes—like code standards, post-mortems, or automated testing. Though they have these robust systems for iterative improvements, they lack robust systems to deliver the next big thing, and struggle to develop them." — Andy Johns

**Underlying Mechanism**

The need for systems emerges from two growth dynamics. First, customer expectations evolve—users expect increasing value over time, and only big bets deliver step-change improvements that meet rising expectations. Second, growth velocity requirements intensify—most companies need 2-3x year-over-year growth, and small iterations cannot sustain this rate. The companies that thrive are those that build systematic capabilities for big bet delivery before they desperately need them.

**Connections to Other Ideas**

This philosophy connects directly to the conviction-building process (Chapter 2), which provides systematic ways to validate ideas before committing resources. It also underlies the Dynamic Delivery Planning approach (Chapter 3), which creates structure while preserving flexibility. The theme recurs in Execution & Adaptation (Chapter 6), where systematic rhythms like kick-offs and product reviews replace ad-hoc communication.

**Practical Application**

The practical implication is that leaders must invest in delivery infrastructure before they face their next big bet. This means developing templates for conviction documents, establishing product review rhythms, creating runbook frameworks, and building the organizational muscle for cross-functional coordination. The investment feels like overhead until the moment it saves months of rework or prevents a devastating late-stage blow-up.

**Nuances & Limitations**

This framework explicitly focuses on "big bet" innovations—products that require significant investment (typically 6-12 months) and carry substantial uncertainty. It does not apply to quick wins, feature work, or growth experiments, which benefit from faster, more iterative approaches. The challenge is recognizing when a project has crossed the threshold from feature to big bet, which often happens gradually as scope expands.

### Three Company Archetypes That Fail

**The Hacker Company** avoids big boulders entirely, scaling through many "quick win" products. This approach eventually hits diminishing returns—the easy wins get exhausted, and growth stagnates without fundamental product evolution. These companies often have excellent engineering processes for small changes but no capability for larger innovations.

**The Fixer Company** relies on rockstar individuals who "patch together" processes to deliver. This doesn't scale—rockstars burn out, the company creates bottlenecks around individual bandwidth, and growth becomes limited by ability to recruit and retain exceptional individuals. The knowledge of how things work lives in people's heads rather than in transferable systems.

**The Visionary Company** consistently generates great ideas but fails to execute. Teams are expected to "figure out" execution without systematic support. Visibility and rewards go to ideation rather than delivery. Credibility erodes when products fail to ship or flop at launch.

> "Your best idea that never makes it to market means nothing to your customer, to your company, and ultimately to your career." — Matt Greenberg

### The Four-Pulley System

The solution is a systematic approach with four key elements, each addressing a specific failure mode:

| Pulley | Purpose | Problem Solved |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Product Conviction** | Build confidence you're solving the right problem | Big bets driven by opinion rather than validation |
| **Dynamic Delivery Plan** | Balance structure and flexibility in planning | Agile/Waterfall inadequacy for large-scale uncertainty |
| **Execution & Adaptation** | Maintain alignment through new learnings | Product reviews as status updates rather than calibration |
| **Launch Strategy** | Maximize impact after development | Strategy ending at launch rather than planning for impact |

**Best companies develop "superpower" elements** where they differentiate their product development: Google with Design Sprints for building conviction, Asana with delivery planning, Intuit and Amazon with product reviews, Credit Karma with product launches.

## 2. Building Product Conviction

### Why Product Sense Alone Fails

**Core Concept**

Many organizations rely on a few key decision-makers with strong "product sense" when making big decisions about pursuing new ideas. Product sense—the intuitive judgment that comes from experience—is valuable but has fundamental limitations that become acute as organizations scale.

The conviction-building process transforms fuzzy product sense into structured, validated understanding. It consists of four interlocking elements: **customer value conviction** (validating you're solving a real problem), **business impact conviction** (estimating revenue through lo-fi modeling), **effort required conviction** (identifying technical risks), and **product-engineering alignment** (ensuring both leaders independently support the initiative).

**Underlying Mechanism**

Product sense fails for three interconnected reasons:

**The Scalability Problem**: Product sense is ambiguous, making it difficult to understand and transfer. It cannot scale as startups grow from a few people to hundreds. Decentralizing decision-making requires something more teachable than intuition.

**The Dependency Problem**: The more you rely on product sense, the less you develop other abilities (communication, alignment-building). The more product sense you have, the less you feel the need to validate before building. Teams struggle to achieve visionary goals without significant translation from the leader.

**The Fallibility Problem**: Even product-led visionary founders can be wrong. Great companies develop processes for building conviction regardless of whether the idea came from product sense, customer interviews, usage data, or any other source.

> "Great teams know that they have to go slow to go fast. The best thing you can do to make products ship faster is know when to slow down and make sure you get all the right information." — Matt Greenberg

**Connections to Other Ideas**

Conviction-building connects to the alignment themes in Chapter 5—the process creates shared understanding that enables teams to make hundreds of subsequent decisions independently. It also feeds directly into Dynamic Delivery Planning (Chapter 3), where the documented hypotheses become benchmarks for evaluating progress and making tradeoff decisions.

**Practical Application**

Building conviction typically requires 2-3 weeks of focused work before committing to 6-12 months of development. This investment is asymmetric: the downside is small (delayed start), while the upside is enormous (avoiding months of wasted effort on products that flop). The process also creates a critical artifact—documented hypotheses and assumptions that serve as benchmarks throughout development.

**Nuances & Limitations**

There's a Goldilocks problem: too little conviction leads to building the wrong thing, while too much conviction (running extensive market research, developing detailed financial models) creates overinvestment when there are still many unknowns. The goal is an 80/20 answer that ensures quality decisions with imperfect information.

### Defining the Ideal Customer

**Core Concept**

Customer value conviction requires three components—like three legs of a stool: an ideal customer profile, a valuable problem to solve, and a user-validated solution. Getting the customer definition wrong cascades through everything else.

> "Product leaders often have an idea about what to build and just go build it, without first thinking about who they're building it for." — Andy Johns

**Common Pitfalls**

**Same Customer Assumption**: Assuming the new product is for the exact same core user optimizes for what your customer base looked like in the past. Apple continued releasing similar iPhones without adapting to emerging markets, leading to declining sales until they introduced lower-price phones.

**"Everyone" as Customer**: Trying to please multiple target users at once results in a product that serves no one well. The Chevy Volt tried to optimize for everyone with a hybrid approach, serving nobody well. Tesla started by selling a high-end sports car to ~2,500 customers, focusing on exceptional functionality for a niche.

**The Three Attribute Types**

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Demographic** | Observable characteristics | Age, gender, geography, income, education |
| **Psychographic** | Beliefs and values | Investment philosophy, openness to automation |
| **Position** | Role within organization/relationship | Industry, company size, title, budget authority |

The goal is to identify 2-3 key attributes that specifically describe the user who will get the most value from the product—and is therefore most likely to adopt first.

### Problem Definition & Validation

**Core Concept**

Every customer problem exists within one or more of four macro areas, forming the CCFA Framework:

| Problem Area | Question | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Cost** | Are current solutions prohibitively expensive? | High-end financial planning only for wealthy |
| **Convenience** | Are current solutions easy to use? | Tax filing takes too long |
| **Functionality** | Do alternatives have necessary features? | Missing expense tracking |
| **Access** | Are current solutions easy to access/adopt? | Local experiences unavailable |

These areas typically exist in a ranked order in the customer's mind. The goal is to document your assumption and test it to discover the true rank order. Tesla early adopters cared more about access to superior technology than price. Model 3 adopters care more about cost.

**Problem Severity Scale**

| Level | Description | Implication |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Vegetable** | Low intent to solve, low willingness to pay | Avoid building |
| **Vitamin** | Moderate desire, moderate willingness to pay | Risky—could flop |
| **Painkiller** | Desperate to find solution, high willingness to pay | Best opportunity |

> "The most common mistake Product Leaders make is assuming all problems are painkiller problems. The truth is that most problems are low-grade, unworthy of a multi-month effort."

**Validation criteria for painkiller status**: Evidence that users have tried to solve the problem in multiple ways in the past. The more extreme their past efforts, the greater confidence it's a painkiller.

**Case Studies in Problem Definition**

**Credit Karma Tax** assumed users' main problem was cost (wanting a truly free solution). The actual problem was convenience and functionality (which TurboTax already addressed). Result: Failed to win market despite being free.

**Wealthfront 529 Plan** thought they were solving significant pain with a streamlined, automated experience. Users were satisfied with existing solutions—didn't see it as worth trying something new. They learned that 529 plans are the *last* financial product well-to-do households consider.

**Quibi** identified the trend toward shorter-form, mobile-first video and built short versions of traditional TV shows. They missed that young consumers prefer user-generated, meme-oriented content over traditional sitcoms. Form factor didn't matter—substance did.

### The Takeaway Conversation

**Core Concept**

The takeaway conversation is one of the most powerful techniques for separating genuine demand from polite agreement. It forces honesty from potential customers by asking for real commitment (money, time) after they express interest.

> "It's easy for the customer to tell you 'Yeah, sure, sure. Go build that thing,' because they don't want to offend you. It's easier for them to give an appeasing answer and then you walk away with false signals." — Andy Johns

> "People are good at hearing what they want in user interviews. They are eager to hear that users want their solution. The truth is everybody wants everything until they have to pay for it, so wanting it isn't really that meaningful." — Matt Greenberg

**Underlying Mechanism**

The traditional pathway is Design → Build → Sell. The better pathway is **Sell → Design → Build**. The takeaway conversation "sells" the concept before building:

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. **Introduce Solution** | Verbally describe solution (1-2 min script) | Set clear expectations |
| 2. **Ask Soft Commitment** | "Would you want to use this product?" | Baseline interest |
| 3. **Introduce Takeaway** | Ask for real commitment (credit card, down payment) | Force genuine decision |
| 4. **Ask Firm Commitment** | Tabulate yes/no responses | Measure true demand |
| 5. **Drill Down** | For soft-yes → no conversions, ask "why?" persistently | Extract truth |

**Critical rule**: A "soft yes" is a "no."

> "Anyone that's worked in sales knows that a hesitant 'yes' is actually a 'no'. Make sure to categorize any hesitant 'yes' responses as a 'no' response."

> "If you haven't lost a few customers by the end of the takeaway exercise, because you made them uncomfortable with your persistence in understanding why they are reluctant to make a firm commitment after making a soft commitment, then you are not doing this portion of the process correctly. The truth is discovered uncomfortably." — Andy Johns

**Practical Application**

Takeaway examples by business model:
- *Transactional/B2B*: One-time payment
- *Subscription*: Payment information or personal information
- *Wealthfront example*: Asked qualified users to wire $100,000 in the same week

When drilling down, interpret feedback carefully: feedback incompatible with the idea suggests wrong customer profile; feedback about missing features suggests solution doesn't yet solve the painkiller problem.

### Prototyping for Conviction

**Core Concept**

At the conviction stage, use the lowest fidelity possible—pencil sketches, wireframes, walkthroughs with fake data. The goal is testing understanding and delight, not polished implementation.

> "It's really difficult to have a successful kick-off meeting for a new product without having something tangible that shows your team the vision for the product you want to build." — Andy Johns

**Testing for Understanding vs. Delight**

**Understanding** means users can concisely describe what you're building and its basic value.

**Moment of Delight** is the reaction to the product's unique value proposition—indication it solves a particularly painful problem.

> "There's a big difference between users who say, 'Ah I see, this is a productivity product' and those who express delight, like: 'Wow, when can I start using this!?' If you're not seeing the latter, you might not have figured out what the most important customer pain point and opportunity for delight are." — Andy Johns

> "If users understand what you're building, and express zero emotion or enthusiasm for it, that should be a leading indicator that you might be proposing a solution to a low-grade problem." — Andy Johns

**If no delight**: Go back to the drawing board. Otherwise, you'll spend months building a dud.

### The Lo-Fi Model

**Core Concept**

Product leaders often use intuition for business impact: "This product could generate $100M a year!" This approach fails because humans are bad at complex estimation, it provides no helpful reference points when results differ, and it leads to organizational skepticism.

The lo-fi model breaks revenue estimation into smaller components using Fermi decomposition, producing more accurate forecasts while revealing the key assumptions that determine success or failure.

> "A good lo-fi model is like Goldilocks. It's detailed enough to be clear and actionable, but not too detailed to create false precision." — Matt Greenberg

**The Five Steps**

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1. **Define the Narrative** | What story are you trying to tell? What must be true? |
| 2. **Determine Time Horizon** | How long until adoption and retention stabilize? |
| 3. **Lay Out Model Structure** | Break revenue into subcomponents |
| 4. **Make High-Quality Estimates** | Use Fermi decomposition (anchor + adjust) |
| 5. **Sense-Check the Outcome** | Range outputs, identify critical assumptions |

**Fermi Decomposition** (named after physicist Enrico Fermi): Start with an anchor on external known data point, then adjust based on internal view. For example, to estimate Chicago population: anchor on NYC (~9 million), adjust (Chicago is smaller, maybe a little less than half), estimate ~4 million (actual: 2.7M—still much closer than random guess).

**Best practice**: Be conservative. If conservative estimates still show outsized impact, that's good. If optimism is required for success, that's a risk.

> "A common mistake when modeling for 2-3 year impact is forgetting the rest of the business changes, too. You need to think about what the business is going to look like in the future." — Matt Greenberg

### Product-Engineering Alignment

**Core Concept**

The conviction process culminates in alignment between product and engineering leaders. Both should develop recommendations independently, then compare.

| Recommendation | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Support** | Fully on board |
| **Conditionally Support** | On board if conditions are met |
| **Conditionally Oppose** | Has reservations but willing ("disagree and commit") |
| **Actively Oppose** | Strong objections; will escalate if not addressed |

**Ideal outcome**: Aligned recommendations from both leaders.

> "The best way to screw up a project at this stage is to be in opposition at the start. That opposition compounds and dooms the project." — Matt Greenberg

> "Most PMs feel like they wish they knew more about engineering; most engineers incorrectly feel like they know everything a PM knows." — Matt Greenberg

---

## 3. Dynamic Planning

### The Planning Paradox

**Core Concept**

Large-scale innovative product development faces a fundamental paradox: you need to make commitments (launch dates, resources, budget) while knowing that many assumptions will be wrong. Neither Agile nor Waterfall adequately addresses this tension.

**The stakes of mis-estimation**:
- **Overestimate**: Work may never start (seems too expensive), or projects expand to match resources instead of staying lean
- **Underestimate**: Forces difficult late-stage decisions—cut scope, negotiate for more resources, or push launch dates

Real-world failures illustrate the consequences: Boeing 787 Dreamliner was 3 years late with $17-23B in delays from delivery plan errors. Cyberpunk 2077 had multiple delays, released with critical bugs, and faced massive backlash.

**Underlying Mechanism**

**Agile limitations**:
| Area | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Estimation | Can't handle "long poles" that don't fit sprint cycles |
| Sequencing | Too short-term for external commitments and securing resources |
| Delegation | Requires all collaborators to adopt Agile structure |
| Risk | Relies on resolving risks through iteration—lacks tools for large-scale risk |

**Waterfall limitations**:
| Area | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Estimation | False precision—detailed models based on wrong assumptions |
| Sequencing | Too rigid—requires immense detail before starting |
| Delegation | Central ownership creates high overhead as things change |
| Risk | Too optimistic—assumes all risks mitigated before work begins |

> "Over the last 10+ years we've seen an overreliance on the orthodoxy of quick, iterative shipping in the religion of 'lean development' and Agile." — Andy Johns

> "We moved away from a strong scrum model, and started to create something more flexible for executing at scale." — Matt Greenberg (on Credit Karma's evolution)

**The Dynamic Delivery approach** captures critical planning details early but builds in room to evolve. Leaders focus on orchestrating across teams and making tradeoff decisions while delegating detailed planning to those closest to the work.

### Work Breakdown Structure

**Core Concept**

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) identifies work by starting with large blocks, then breaking into component parts until reaching tasks of meaningful size. The critical insight is to build bottom-up, not top-down.

> "A lot of people start with top-down work plans—they pick key delivery dates and fit the workplan to make those dates. However, this often results in teams developing unrealistic plans from the get-go." — Matt Greenberg

**Standard WBS categories**:
- **Core Product**: Front-end cross-platform + back-end business logic
- **Growth**: Features driving traffic to the product
- **Infrastructure**: Networking, databases, storage
- **Third-Party Integrations**: External organization requirements
- **Launch Readiness**: Admin panels, metrics, monitoring, QA
- **Non-Technical**: Marketing, legal, customer support, compliance, security

**Common WBS mistakes**:
1. Forgetting non-technical work (security, compliance, support, marketing, legal)
2. Forgetting launch-readiness work (QA, testing, admin panels, metrics)
3. Including too much scope (not all moments of delight need V1)
4. Building in isolation (product/engineering should deliberate together)
5. Leaving assumptions unstated (document them for later validation)

### Complexity Assessment

**Core Concept**

Use t-shirt sizing to categorize complexity, then estimate both time and resources needed.

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Straightforward** | We know how to do this / done before | CRUD operations |
| **Normal** | Done something similar with nuances | Language localization |
| **Complicated** | Never done before, don't know anything | Hiring in new country |
| **Very Complicated** | No one has ever done this before | Novel technical integrations |

> "Anytime you use t-shirt sizing as an estimation tool, there's a tendency to choose the 'medium' option for all work. I like to use comparisons within each 'size' to sense check if the work is actually all a similar level." — Matt Greenberg

**Baseline units of value**:
- Projects > 1 quarter: no smaller than 1 person-month
- Projects < 1 quarter: no smaller than 1 person-week

This avoids false precision (early estimates contain many assumptions) and death by 1000 cuts (prevents negotiating away days without meaningful progress).

**Complexity factors** when comparing to historical examples:

| Factor | Definition | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Scale** | Users and segments using the product | 10K users vs 2M users on day one |
| **Stability** | Uptime/performance expectations | Financial transactions vs. checking scores |
| **Access** | Data availability and configuration | Existing data systems vs. new storage |
| **Magnitude** | Size of product change | Small aspect vs. whole new experience |

**Four types consistently underestimated**:
1. **Data**: Minor front-end changes can require massive back-end scope
2. **Infrastructure**: Large projects cross different systems
3. **Shared surfaces**: Multiple team ownership slows consensus
4. **3rd Party Integrations**: Too many unknowns outside your organization

> "Very rarely does the first version meet the quality bar necessary to truly delight customers." — Andy Johns (include rework time)

> "Often people are optimizing their initial estimates for project approval. At this stage you should optimize for the most realistic estimates for delivering the scope." — Matt Greenberg

### Sequencing & Dependencies

**Core Concept**

Large-scale launches require longer time horizons, orchestration across multiple teams, and management of complex dependencies. Like preparing Thanksgiving dinner where everything must come together warm at the same time, the job is figuring out what to do in what order.

**Milestones** are intermediate points where work integrates for an output. They matter because they provide objective visibility into tangible outputs (not subjective status updates), create positive momentum, and uncover misaligned expectations early.

> "There are unstated assumptions and expectations that everyone always has in every communication. Milestones are your way to bring those to the forefront as early as possible." — Matt Greenberg

> "Status updates are meaningless to me. I'd much rather see the progress demonstrated in a functional output than hear that the work is 'green.'" — Matt Greenberg

**Three qualities of meaningful milestones**:
1. **Demonstrate increasing fidelity**: Demo → Fishfood → Dogfood → Launch ready
2. **Obviously understandable**: External people can assess without deep context
3. **Right level of detail**: Appropriate for exec or cross-functional audience

**Interim outputs** break milestones into smaller components. They give the strongest signal when they demonstrate work from two separate teams integrated into one functional output.

> "If you skip integrating in staging and instead do it in production, you'll still have to integrate it. And it's usually harder to do—maybe the tools are more complicated, you have less access, or you have to reboot something and wait until a maintenance window." — Matt Greenberg

**Five dependency sources**:

| Source | Definition | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Input-output** | One task must complete before another starts | Mock designs → front-end code |
| **Integrations** | Parallel work must come together | Data infrastructure + new model |
| **3P conditions** | External partner constraints | IRS testing windows |
| **Resources** | Limited team availability | Android team only available March-April |
| **Important dates** | Holidays, QBRs, board meetings | Reduces capacity |

**Long poles** require the longest time investment and fundamentally shape how you approach everything else—like the longest pole in a tent changing the whole structure.

> "Any time product development requires integration with a 3rd party, the 3rd party requirements are the long pole dependency in the project." — Matt Greenberg

### Delegation & Alignment

**Core Concept**

Product and engineering leaders must focus on where they add most value. The Waterfall approach of owning detailed master plans leads to micromanaging, false precision, and multiplied problems with cross-functional dependencies. The Agile approach of little central ownership loses accountability and alignment with other teams and execs.

The Dynamic approach focuses on maximum value through:
1. **Delegate**: Give ownership to core team members to pressure test, add detail, surface risks
2. **Manage**: Confirm alignment with cross-functional teams and exec sponsors

> "A common challenge new product and engineering leaders face is that they fail to grok the plan as a group, and end up missing a lot of necessary work early in the development process." — Matt Greenberg

> "Leaders who get too deep in the details tend to break their brain. It's too much for one person to know and stay on top of as things inevitably change." — Matt Greenberg

> "A lot of product leaders take a passive role in pressure-testing the plan, leaving all assumptions for the engineering leader to validate. Actually, you want to be involved in pressure testing the plan. You want to know what will be hard and what is uncertain." — Andy Johns

**Three components of great delegation**:

| Component | What to Share |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Provide context** | Customer problem, priority user profiles, moments of delight, known tasks, effort estimates, milestones, dependencies, long poles |
| **Make clear request** | Add detail, validate assumptions, flag risks |
| **Give additive feedback** | Right interim outputs? Right milestones? Reasonable timing? |

**Managing exec sponsors**:

The mistake is shying away from surfacing friction-causing assumptions to avoid early blow-ups. The reality is that early blow-ups can be good—especially when validating unshared assumptions.

**Common sticking points** relate to constraints:
- **Time**: Sponsor has strong date requirement
- **Scope**: Exec has different moment of delight opinion
- **Resources**: Never enough, conflicting priorities

> "Compromise is making no one more unhappy than they can tolerate being. The right plan makes everyone disappointed, but not to their breaking point." — Matt Greenberg

## 4. Risk & Tradeoffs

### Assumptions and Risks

**Core Concept**

Throughout planning, you make assumptions to manage uncertainty. This is necessary but dangerous if left untested. Assumptions are constraints on unknown questions that could materially affect your plan. Risks manifest when answers to those questions are incorrect.

> "Very rarely does the first version meet the quality bar necessary to truly delight customers." — Andy Johns

**The common mistake**: Leaving assumptions untested until bumping into them, then saying "how could anyone have known?"

**The dynamic approach**: Build in time to validate assumptions throughout development—it's your way of mitigating risk.

### Four Risk Types

**1. Customer Understanding**
Original understanding of problem, user segments, moments of delight may be incorrect. Learning evolves throughout the project. Risk: Changes in scope that jeopardize shipping on time.

**2. Technical Complexities**
Work takes more time/resources than estimated because tools don't work as expected, estimated effort assumed optimal capacity (holidays erode time), or engineers are simply wrong about difficulty. Common sources: Data, Infrastructure, Shared Surfaces, 3rd Party Integrations.

**3. Scope Expansion**
Unknown work not in original plan because plan built on "happy path" only, product leaders add "small" things requiring heavy back-end lift, engineers don't plan for monitoring/admin panels/metrics, business decisions change work, or regulatory requirements emerge.

**4. Resource Dependencies**
Assumptions that may not hold: access to specialized resources, hired headcount starting by target date, promised future headcount, local hires for new markets.

> "This is where most Agile teams struggle as they start to scale to bigger, more complex projects, especially if their project was not given freedom to urgently pull people in and reprioritize their work." — Matt Greenberg

### Risk Mitigation

**Meta-Tasks** improve plan accuracy by getting more information about assumptions and risks. They don't produce product development work.

> "We had a PM at Wealthfront that started the project by listing all of the important questions that we didn't have answers to, and developed a plan for answering those questions. This was one of the most useful exercises in what made them successful at product development." — Andy Johns

**Questions to identify meta-tasks**:
- What assumptions do we need to validate?
- What information could validate our assumptions?
- What are the signals that a risk will materialize?

**Front-Loading Adjustments**: Teams often wait for all requirements before starting next task to avoid rework. For large-scale work, most things won't finalize until late—pushing critical work to the end.

> "As a leader, you want to be involved in the most complex parts of the development process. If you plan for all of the complexity to happen at the end, you're setting yourself up to make mistakes, or at the very least, stretch yourself too thin right before launch." — Andy Johns

**Bias toward front-loading work**, even if it introduces rework possibility. Deploy infrastructure before you need it. Test value propositions before the product is finalized.

**Pressure Testing Failure States**: Many projects scope only the "happy path"—the experience when users face no challenges.

**Three unhappy path types**:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Performance failures** | Service unavailable or slow | 3P API returns error |
| **Application logic failures** | User state breaks experience | Two credit scores, pages don't know which to return |
| **Security/access failures** | Authentication issues | Password update logs users out of other devices |

> "Early on in my career, the way I asked questions about unhappy paths upset people. Though these are important conversations to have, they need to occur from a place of empathy." — Matt Greenberg

> "The reality is, most product and engineering leaders think through failure states at some point in the development lifecycle, but it's often too late, and the work isn't scoped into your delivery plan yet." — Andy Johns

### The Firefighting Cycle

**Core Concept**

Leaders make optimistic early estimates, assuming they'll "make it happen" or "get more."

> "The mindset that we'll just overclock ourselves and get it done comes from a good place, but isn't sustainable for a large-scale project." — Andy Johns

**The cascading effect**: Plan A asks for more time/resources → Plan A grabs from Plan B → Plan B grabs from Plan C → Plan C grabs from Plan A...

> "In many organizations, fire fighting is the development process. Thus, fire fighting is not a complement to a more structured approach to new product development, but is, instead, an organizational pathology that, left unchecked, can significantly degrade an organization's ability to create high-quality products." — MIT Center for Innovation in Product Development

### Making Tradeoffs Early

> "To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan and not quite enough time." — Leonard Bernstein

**Why tradeoff decisions are hard**: Leaders lack experience to draw from, and leaders lean on same tradeoffs regardless of context.

**The system**: Anchor on three constraints—Scope, Time, Resources.

**Time Tradeoffs**:

| Option | Works When | Doesn't Work When |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Move launch dates | Not date-dependent | Launch tied to customer needs (tax season) |
| Reduce QA/testing | Experimental product | Delight depends on quality; regulated space |
| Shift tooling post-launch | Low KPI expectations | Big press release, large marketing push |

> "You hear things like, 'Oh, we'll just ramp to 1% of users and see what happens instead of doing QA.' What this means is that you're going to find issues but not be able to meaningfully clean them up." — Matt Greenberg

**Scope Tradeoffs**:

> "MVP is not the easiest thing for you to ship and still solve the problem—instead it's the minimum needed to deliver at least one form of customer delight." — Andy Johns

| Option | Works When | Doesn't Work When |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Reduce features | Still delivers moments of delight | Delight requires all features |
| Reduce complexity | Delight achievable with simpler version | Simpler doesn't meet bar |
| Reduce quality | High-risk product likely rebuilt | Erodes delight |
| Reduce user segments | Few segments represent bulk of early usage | All segments priority |

> "A big difference between senior and junior leaders is in their ability to find simple solutions that generate moments of delight. Each feature does not need to be complex to create delight, if it still meets a high quality bar." — Andy Johns

> "It's easy to scope out all the bells and whistles. But oftentimes the bells are the things that make the product feel complete and good, and you're better off cutting features." — Andy Johns

> "Most often, it's better to have one premium experience for your most important user than a few average experiences." — Matt Greenberg

**Resource Tradeoffs**:

Adding more people works when early in lifecycle and work is isolated (own file, own surface, own experience). It doesn't work when work is across shared surfaces, teams writing code in same files, integrating with centralized dashboards, late in project (people assigned elsewhere), or late in project (ramp-up time exceeds value).

## 5. Alignment at Scale

### The Speedboat-to-Ship Transition

**Core Concept**

The shift to executing large-scale project work is like transitioning from a speedboat to a large ship.

**Speedboat**: Direct control over almost all variables, quick maneuvering, unknown risks appear quickly enabling easy adaptation, destinations close to shore.

**Ship**: Requires an entire crew operating in harmony, big redirections happen in small incremental shifts, new information requires crew identification and timely sharing, destinations are loftier and harder to reach.

> "Developing innovative products at scale would be super easy if it was one human working with a million robots. The robots would all be aligned on what to do, how, and when. They'd stay motivated and compliant. All companies would launch big new things all the time. But one of the main reasons why this is hard is because we all work with groups of humans." — Matt Greenberg

> "As we all know, humans are very difficult creatures, with their own ideas, goals, energy levels, and perspectives. The more humans you're working with, the more important it is to build strong alignment to get big things done."

### Vector Math of Teams

**Core Concept**

This framework from Dharmesh Shah and Elon Musk provides the mental model for understanding alignment.

> "Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." — Elon Musk

**Key principles**:
- People are vectors with **magnitude** (impact, 1-10) and **direction** (destination)
- When vectors link together and point in the same direction, magnitudes are additive
- When vectors have any variation in direction, they detract from one another
- When vectors point opposite, total impact is zero

> "These vectors all exist in a space, with all the possible directions your product or company could go in that space. In order to build alignment effectively, you need to describe the destination clearly, so people can find the path that directs their efforts entirely towards that destination. The clearer your description, the easier it will be for all your people to find the path that gets them there." — Matt Greenberg

**Common misalignment patterns**:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Opposite directions** | Fundamentally different objectives | Some believe you should refine existing product |
| **Slightly different directions** | Loosely related but unaligned | Multiple teams building portions independently |
| **Parallel vectors** | Same direction but not collaborating | Aligned on what/how but not leveraging each other |

> "It's very common to have strong dissent amongst the biggest ideas. People have their own visions for where the company should go and pet projects to promote, so it's critical to recognize dissent and have a plan to build alignment." — Andy Johns

**Wealthfront example**: In 2015, they attempted to redesign the main dashboard without strategic alignment on the new feature set. The team worked for months cobbling together a Frankenstein solution that was so low-quality they threw it away without ever putting it in customers' hands.

### True Alignment: Two Components

| Component | Question | When Missing |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Strategic Alignment** | Are our vectors pointed in the right direction? | Material components get reworked or scrapped late |
| **Execution Alignment** | Are our magnitudes additive? | Teams unclear on leveraging each other |

**True alignment enables the Information at Scale Loop**:
1. **Uncovering new information**: Core team members, dependency teams, and execs communicate emerging risks and learnings early
2. **Making decisions to adapt**: The core team can make thoughtful decisions quickly
3. **Communicating decisions**: Right channels re-align stakeholders, which provides new information, restarting the cycle

### Preventing Late-Stage Blow-Ups

**Core Concept**

A late-stage blow-up occurs when a critical stakeholder intervenes and redirects a product development effort in a big way, resulting in significant rework. It typically happens late because key stakeholders often require seeing and reviewing products before delivery to customers.

> "When late-stage blow-ups happen, it's devastating to the team, the company, and your customers. The blow-up requires you to stop what you're doing, scrap a ton of work, and reassess what to do next to align with the direction the team has been given." — Andy Johns

**Why they happen**: As companies scale, execs become abstracted from daily execution. They can afford more parallel projects, becoming detached from what's being built. But as leaders, they remain heavily invested and inject themselves at the finish line.

**Consequences**:
- **Builds resentment**: No one likes throwing out months of work
- **Creates distrust**: Execs question judgment, trust is very hard to regain
- **Lost time**: Development halts, deliverables scrapped, launch delays

> "If a team is building the right thing, but they say something is 12 weeks of work and it's actually 16, then it's not the end of the world. However, if the opposite is true, and they estimated correctly but what they are building isn't aligned with the vision for the company, then the implications are pretty disastrous." — Matt Greenberg

> "A 10% difference in assumption matters at the beginning. Everyone goes off to make hundreds of decisions after that point based on slightly different rubrics." — Matt Greenberg

**Prevention Strategy**:
- **Kick-Off**: Build strategic alignment (get vectors pointed right from the beginning)
- **Product Reviews**: Maintain strategic alignment (re-assess direction at regular cadence)

---

## 6. Execution Rhythms

### Kick-Off

**Core Concept**

Kick-off builds strategic alignment by driving cross-functional and cross-level buy-in on strategic objectives, prior to development.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Objective** | Build strategic alignment |
| **Audience** | Core team execs, core team members, dependency teams |
| **Format** | Live meeting, 45-60 minutes |
| **Outcome** | Everyone understands why, what, and how |

> "At Wealthfront, Kick-Off is where we started our product development process, because the single largest development problem we were experiencing was that product teams would get to the tail end of development and then execs would come in and blow the thing up." — Andy Johns

**Why teams skip kick-off (and shouldn't)**:
- "Everyone signed off on the delivery plan and prototypes"
- Steep timeline pressure
- Perceiving kick-off as executive oversight

**Symptoms indicating you need kick-off**:
- Team misaligned on what/why
- False starts requiring more direction
- Death by 1000 cuts from stakeholder input
- Dependency teams failing to deliver

> "An ineffective kickoff can feel like an orchestrated show with minimal participation. But a great kickoff can be a lever for making sure the team is bought in and knows how the success ties together." — Matt Greenberg

**Kick-Off Content Structure**:

| Question | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Why?** | Customer Value + Business Impact |
| **What?** | Prototype walkthrough |
| **How?** | Delivery plan overview |

> "A strong understanding of who you're building for and what problem you're trying to solve for them is the first step to ensuring the team will be aligned on the next 100 decisions after Kick-Off." — Andy Johns

**Development Themes** synthesize the most important principles for stakeholders to remember throughout development. Credit Karma Savings had three: 4-click sign-up, industry best rates, smooth integration.

> "A great 'why' story is well synthesized, with clear and concise language that's easy to repeat. It highlights themes, and these themes aid in memory and recall for teams as they try to keep alignment and make their own decisions." — Matt Greenberg

> "I like to think about new product development like you're an internal venture capitalist. After all, if you ask for a handful of people to work on a project for a few months, you're effectively asking for a pre-seed round of financing from the leadership of the company." — Andy Johns

**Insight Impact Spectrum**:

| Impact Level | Format Type |
|--------------|-------------|
| **High** | Interactive, experiential (interview clips, live panels) |
| **Medium** | Passively consumed (data visualizations, customer quotes) |
| **Low** | Static (tables, industry report snippets) |

When insight is surprising AND audience is similar to user: need high impact because people prefer holding existing beliefs.

> "It's not hard to communicate market insights if they're exactly what we think they're going to be. It's also not hard to communicate market insights if you work at a company where the team is really interested in hearing market insights that are counterintuitive or surprising. But, if the insights are not intuitive, and your stakeholders aren't open to being surprised by new information, then it's very hard to communicate those things directly and you need a more impactful approach." — Matt Greenberg

> "One of the best outcomes from a kick-off is when after you take people through the why story, everyone in the room starts nodding their head and comes to the same conclusion—we need to build this product." — Matt Greenberg [He calls this an "And Therefore moment."]

### Product Reviews

**Core Concept**

Product reviews maintain strategic alignment by facilitating real-time feedback on interim outputs, escalating needs, and resolving open questions.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Objective** | Maintain strategic alignment |
| **Audience** | Exec team and core team |
| **Format** | Live meeting, 45-60 minutes |
| **Outcome** | Exec team provides feedback and coaching on strategic direction |

> "At the highest level, product reviews should minimize the ongoing divergence of expectations and reality to keep everyone on the same page. The lower the ongoing divergence, the less likely a late-stage blow-up will occur." — Andy Johns

**Why teams avoid them**:

> "I was once actively trying to hire someone for a Head of Product role, and when they heard that part of the job expectations was running effective Product Reviews, they immediately backed out because they didn't want the oversight. They had a prior CEO that was notorious for late-stage blow-ups, so they didn't want any form of executive involvement in product development." — Andy Johns

> "I frequently come across wounded PMs that no longer want the execs involved in the development process because of late-stage blow-ups, but the ironic solution to that problem is a recurring product review." — Andy Johns

**Two approaches**:

| Approach | Purpose | Vector Theory |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Input & Feedback** | Share interim outputs for exec feedback | Points core team toward exec/company priorities |
| **Resolution & Awareness** | Elevate decisions, share context on risks | Points exec team toward core team learnings |

Choose based on what drives late-stage blow-ups at your company (vision divergence → Input & Feedback; operational complexities → Resolution & Awareness).

> "I think about reviews as an opportunity to clear the road so my teams can keep moving quickly. I need to use this meeting to resolve the things I can't clear on my own, or for someone to identify the things I don't see so that the team can keep moving really, really fast." — Matt Greenberg

**Feedback Fidelity Fit**: Ensure deliverable fidelity matches feedback level needed.

| Fidelity | Output Examples | Feedback Examples |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Low** | Wireframes, slides | Strategic input, reactions to options |
| **High** | Demos, pixel-perfect prototypes | Approval on copy, staffing decisions |

> "Consider the zoom on a camera. If you want the viewer to focus on the lighting in the landscape, you wouldn't give them a photo zoomed in on the flower." — Fareed Mosavat

> "Even if you can bring a high-fidelity draft to a high-level discussion, it's not always better to do so. If the team is showing me something that looks final, I don't want them to waste their time rebuilding unless something is terribly wrong. And, it's so hard not to react to the pixels that look off when they're right in front of you." — Matt Greenberg

**Clarifying Feedback Types**:

| Type | Definition | Clarify |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Command** | Specific direction with expectation of compliance | Gaps in understanding? Follow-up needed? |
| **Suggestion** | Perspective offered without expecting exact implementation | What problem? What flexibility? Why that suggestion? |
| **Idea** | Perspective without specific problem or expectation | Record for later, redirect if needed |

> "I often give suggestions in the phrasing 'if it were me, I would…' When I do this, I'm expecting teams to use their judgment if they have a strong perspective, but offering mine if they don't." — Matt Greenberg

**Recording Takeaways**:

> "The person who takes notes has the power. They shape the narrative of the meeting. They prioritize which follow-ups you revisit. And they determine ownership of next steps." — Matt Greenberg

> "I've gone back to the notes or change log more than 100 times. The attributed record of feedback + decisions is often the best source for adjudicating misunderstandings months later." — Matt Greenberg

**Rules of Engagement**:
- No multitasking (laptops away except presenter/note taker)
- Focus on customer and business value
- Consider development status (early: no copy discussions)
- Hold questions until team ready
- Limit attendance
- Give input to coach and teach
- Don't bury the lede
- Be brief and efficient

> "It's like a teacher being mad at you for not getting the concept. If anything, it hurts the student's confidence, making it harder to absorb the concept. Product Reviews provide an equal opportunity for executives to learn how to coach junior employees, and for junior employees to learn how to think about the business like an executive." — Andy Johns

**Best practices from Intuit**:
- Dedicated office at headquarters (environmental trigger)
- Strict rules of engagement clearly visible
- Strictly managed attendance
- Visual examples of successful products at each development stage

### Team Touchpoints

**Core Concept**

Functional and dependency team touchpoints build execution alignment. They enable a virtuous information cycle: verify state → make decisions → communicate → cycle restarts.

**Four Common Challenges**:

| Challenge | Problem | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Touchpoints degrade | Status updates instead of surfacing challenges | Async updates + structured live discussions |
| Amorphous problems | Poorly explained, hard to help | Rocks vs. Monkeys framework |
| Intervention struggles | Unclear when/how to intervene | Intervention Decision Tree |
| Disorganized escalation | Separate escalations without context | Clean Escalation culture |

**Rocks vs. Monkeys**:

**Rock Problems** (well-scoped): Like moving a rock from A to B—cognitive load of framing is done, context shared intentionally, root cause identified, options considered, actionable.

> "On my teams we use the principle 'share what matters.' Be concise and intentional about what this audience needs to understand to help solve your problem." — Matt Greenberg

**Monkey Problems** (amorphous): Like babysitting a monkey—chaotic mess, unclear how to help, challenging to discuss in limited time.

> "Often when people don't know what problem the meeting is supposed to solve, or they forget over time, they default to giving updates." — Matt Greenberg

**The Intervention Decision Tree**:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Observe** | High rigor of thought |
| **Direct** | Low rigor + low potential to solve themselves |
| **Coach** | Low rigor + high potential + high learning opportunity |
| **Support** | Low rigor + high potential + low learning opportunity |

> "Allowing teams to bring their best work to a solution they believe in wholeheartedly but takes them slightly off course is okay, because they'll travel further on the thing they believe in than the directive you give them." — Matt Greenberg

> "Sometimes people don't have the skillset or capability to solve the problem, and no amount of coaching will get them there. Once they observe the results of the decision, they'll appreciate why the decision was made to inform other learnings." — Andy Johns

**Clean Escalation**: Two people or teams in disagreement escalate issues together to a neutral decision maker, ideally after trying to resolve themselves.

Benefits: Better decisions (full context), no one caught off guard, demonstrates accountability.

Implementation: Refuse to weigh in on disorganized escalations. Ask to speak with both parties before making decisions.

> "Over time, teams will appreciate a climate of clean escalations, as it reduces the feeling of politics and drama that can often plague large efforts." — Matt Greenberg

---

## 7. Launch Execution

### The Missed Value Framework

**Core Concept**

When launch prep fails, it creates **missed value**—the gap between potential impact and actual impact.

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Wrong Way** | Wrong audience/staging | CoSo rushed to premium customer (10% of revenue); took years to rebuild trust |
| **Wrong Thing** | Wrong feature prioritization | Credit Karma Tax launched without audit protection |
| **Poor Quality** | Insufficient testing | Apple Maps wrong locations; years of perception damage |

> "The missed value for CD Projekt [Cyberpunk 2077] was created by launching to majority of customers at once before testing, sacrificing anticipated features, and launching something barely playable."

### Staging Strategies

**Stage by % of Users**: Big bets have bugs you can't catch in testing. Starting small lets you "flush out the pipes."

Process: Roll out to 1-5% → monitor bugs/tickets → address feedback → ramp up in tranches (10% → 25% → 50%).

**Wealthfront Portfolio Analysis**: Verbose copy and feature-heavy UX. Less than 10% completed. Launched to majority without learning from pitfalls.

**Twitter 2010**: Major newsfeed redesign to all users at once. Within days, following down 30%. For network-effects company, double-digit decline in network creation is disastrous.

**Stage by Customer Segment**:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Requirements** | User groups have different needs (SMB vs enterprise) |
| **Geography** | Regulatory or market differences |
| **Client Importance** | Protect high-value accounts |
| **Representative Sample** | Large user base, want extrapolation |

> **Key Insight**: Even if enterprise accounts are involved in roadmap, avoid launching brand new innovations to them first.

**Stage by Technology Platform**:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Customer Density** | Platform has majority of users |
| **Resource Constraints** | Team specializes in one platform |
| **Platform Compatibility** | Product aligns better with platform |

**Warning**: The more staging strategies combined, the slower reaching most users. Balance thoroughness with speed.

### The Burndown List

**Core Concept**

An itemized, prioritized list of all work needed before launch—everything goes on it (frontend, backend, marketing, bugs, dependencies).

| Category | Definition | Framing Test |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Launch Blocker** | Cannot launch without this | "We aren't launching today because..." |
| **Critical** | Significantly affects user value | Product ships, but value reduced |
| **Non-Critical** | Future enhancement | Value delivery possible without |

> "Overuse of critical often means people might be working on slightly lower value items. If everything is the same priority, nothing is prioritized." — Matt Greenberg

**Capacity Management**: Teams that push for every ounce of effort at launch run out of energy for post-launch.

> "You need to use your judgment when trying to push a team to work unsustainably. It rarely works out to take out a mortgage against your future; almost every time I've done it, I needed that team at their best later and they weren't." — Matt Greenberg

**Speed of Decisions**: In late stages, time is an opportunity cost in every decision. Bias toward speed.

> "When faced with a choice between A and B, leaders want a way out. They want to be able to do both and they spend time looking for an optimal solution instead of making the choice. Choosing both at this stage often costs you both because of future tradeoffs." — Matt Greenberg

**Mantra**: "A good decision today is better than a perfect decision tomorrow."

### The Runbook System

**Core Concept**

Systematized checklists converting loose mental processes into documented procedures.

> "Under conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help, they are required for success." — Atul Gawande

**Each task needs four components**:
1. **Owner**: Name of responsible person
2. **Description**: Detailed task description
3. **Success Outcome**: What success looks like
4. **Deadline**: When it must be done

**Most common mistake**: Runbooks only cover product and engineering, ignoring marketing, customer service, sales, customer success.

**Marketing Runbook** critical tasks: Press releases & events coordination, QA channel messaging (email, push, in-app), QA performance marketing (attribution, promotions).

**Customer Service Runbook** critical tasks: Update FAQ, training for reps, QA ticket platform.

**Sales Runbook** critical tasks: Sales materials, feedback channels.

> "Engaging customer success early in launch prep took a lot of work and likely negative outcomes off the table for the core team, and gave us tons of confidence going into big releases." — Matt Greenberg

**The War Room**: Centralized forum where teams run through checklists live together (like SpaceX launch control). Accelerates execution, faster confirmation, all parties witness tests together.

---

## 8. Post-Launch Management

### Metrics & Instrumentation

**Core Concept**

> "Launching a big bet is like filing for an IPO. You need to prepare for the actual event, but you also need to have a plan for what comes after it. After you ring the bell, you still need to run the business." — Andy Johns

**Life Raft Metrics**: Critical metrics tracking performance and health of the company as a whole. New products can negatively impact them—users might choose new offering over existing one.

**Product Metrics Spectrum**:

| Type | Empathy | Scale |
|------|---------|-------|
| Quantitative | Lower | Higher |
| Qualitative | Higher | Lower |

**Input vs Output Metrics**:

| Type | Timing | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Input** | Short-term, early signal | Acquired users, engagement rates |
| **Output** | Long-term results | ARR, retention |

> **Key Insight**: Input metrics are most important early on—they predict output metrics and indicate whether you'll hit goals.

> "A good baseline metric for complaints is that twenty times the number of users have a problem than file a ticket about it. If you have a few dozen tickets on a topic or more, chances are you have hundreds of users experiencing the same issue." — Andy Johns

**Instrumentation Dimensions**:

| Dimension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Track new actions | Events for actions that didn't exist before |
| Classification | Understand sets of events together (funnels, rates) |
| Track new user states | Account for new user categories |

> "If you aren't measuring something when your product first launched, you just missed the most valuable tracking window for your product."

### Stakeholder Communication

**Four Communication Objectives**:

| Objective | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Educate** | Communicate performance, set expectations |
| **Learn** | Understand their information, get feedback |
| **Influence** | Move, convince, motivate |
| **Decide** | Get specific decisions |

**By Audience**:

| Audience | Objectives | Cadence |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Core Team | Educate + Decide | Daily |
| Dependency Teams | Educate + Learn | Weekly |
| Executive Team | All four | Weekly |

> "The core team had pushed so hard toward the finish line that we had not carefully planned our communication strategy post-launch. We quickly saw that each executive was playing telephone for bits and pieces of functional updates." — Matt Greenberg

### Failure Modes & Recovery

**Five Common Failure Modes**:

| Failure Mode | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Negative Impact on Life Raft** | Twitter 2010: Following down 30% |
| **Poor Leading Indicators** | Facebook Places: Low adoption, removed |
| **Regulatory Failure** | Lime: Cities banned scooter-share |
| **Security Flaws** | Zoom: Strangers could join meetings |
| **Customer Backlash** | Slack external DM: Harassment concerns |

**Four Corrective Strategies**:

| Strategy | When | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Optimize in Place** | Easy to solve | Zoom security fixes |
| **Throttle** | Low-medium severity | Reduce visibility while developing fix |
| **Temporarily Block** | High severity, can't throttle | Robinhood GME trading |
| **Rollback** | No solution in sight | Slack external DM removal |

> "Throttle was our most leveraged strategy at Credit Karma because it gave us time to monitor lagging indicators as we improved issues in the launched product." — Matt Greenberg

### The Four Gears

**Core Concept**

After launch, the challenge shifts from building to adapting. Products enter one of four gears, each requiring fundamentally different approaches.

> "Even though we've spent time building conviction, when the product is truly in the users' hands we can see the reality of all of our hypotheses at play. This reality can be harsh or delightful, but regardless of the outcome, you must transition out of the build gear." — Matt Greenberg

**Gear 1: Accelerate**

Signals: Reaching/exceeding goals, meaningful contribution to life raft, positive feedback, word of mouth.

> "Product market fit doesn't feel like vague idle interest... It really feels like everything in your business has gone totally haywire. There's a big rush of adrenaline from customers starting to adopt it and ripping it out of your hands." — Peter Reinhardt

Backlog priorities: Growth work, fast-follow features, infrastructure scaling, ongoing feedback.

**Gear 2: Wind Down**

Signals: Conviction hypotheses very wrong, missing success metrics by order of magnitude, negative or no feedback.

> "Negative feedback is an important signal, but volume of feedback can be another telling indicator. Getting no customer feedback is even worse than getting a lot of negative feedback, because no feedback means the new product is insignificant to their experience." — Andy Johns

**Wealthfront 529**: Very low feedback volume. Customer support asked if product was even turned on. Users just didn't need it—"veggie problem."

Backlog priorities: Solve existential risks, then move on.

**Gear 3: Improve**

Signals: Clear painkiller problem exists, product doesn't quite solve it, some metrics meeting expectations while others miss, realistic path to close gap.

**Credit Karma Tax**: Free wasn't delightful enough to overcome TurboTax switching costs. But filing data was valuable for other business units.

Backlog priorities: Solve existential risks, stop development of fast-follows based on old hypotheses, strategic reassessment.

**Gear 4: Restart**

Signals: Multiple core hypotheses incorrect, conviction that different approach could succeed, evidence of poor execution/design, possibly toxic team dynamics.

**Credit Karma Auto**: Original product (refinancing) had too much friction. Restarted as "auto hub" with car values, warranties, recalls, insurance, Carvana integration.

Backlog priorities: Solve existential risks, stop development, start over from conviction.

**The Ambiguous Middle**:

> "It's often clear what to do when there's a home run. And it's clear what to do when there's a strikeout. But there's a lot of complexity in the ambiguous zone of singles, doubles, and walk-ons, where it's unclear what is obviously good or bad." — Matt Greenberg

---

## Connections Map

### The Foundational Philosophy

The entire framework rests on a counterintuitive principle: **going slow at critical moments enables going fast overall**. This manifests throughout:

- **Conviction** (2-3 weeks) before committing to 6-12 months of development
- **Kick-offs** that feel like overhead but prevent catastrophic late-stage blow-ups
- **Product reviews** that seem like executive oversight but actually accelerate delivery
- **Front-loading work** that might require rework but prevents late-stage complexity
- **Making tradeoffs early** rather than pushing through with optimistic plans

The common thread is that systematic investment in alignment and validation upfront creates the conditions for efficient execution later. Companies that skip these steps don't actually move faster—they move in circles, experiencing late-stage blow-ups, firefighting cycles, and products that underwhelm.

### The Alignment Thread

The Vector Math of Teams framework provides the underlying theory for why systematic processes matter. Every person is a vector with magnitude and direction. When vectors diverge even slightly, they detract from one another—individual excellence doesn't compound into organizational capability.

This explains why:
- **Conviction documents** matter: they create shared direction for hundreds of subsequent decisions
- **Kick-offs** matter: they get vectors pointed the same way from the beginning
- **Product reviews** matter: they recalibrate direction as information emerges
- **Clean escalation** matters: it maintains trust and prevents political friction from degrading magnitude

### The Estimation-Execution Loop

The frameworks create a virtuous cycle between planning and execution:

1. **Conviction** produces documented hypotheses (customer, problem, solution, business impact)
2. **Dynamic Delivery Plans** translate hypotheses into work breakdown, milestones, and dependencies
3. **Kick-offs** socialize the plan and surface misalignment early
4. **Product Reviews** compare execution against hypotheses, enabling adaptation
5. **Post-launch metrics** validate or invalidate original hypotheses
6. **Retrospectives** capture learnings that improve future conviction-building

Each phase produces artifacts that inform the next, and deviations from expectations become learning opportunities rather than failures.

### Tension Between Structure and Flexibility

A recurring theme is finding the right balance between systematic structure and adaptive flexibility:

- **Neither Agile nor Waterfall**: Dynamic Delivery Plans capture critical details early while building in room to evolve
- **Not too little, not too much conviction**: 80/20 answer rather than full validation or pure intuition
- **Appropriate fidelity**: Low-fidelity prototypes for strategic feedback, high-fidelity for tactical approval
- **Right staging approach**: Thoroughness vs. speed to value

The resolution is always context-dependent. The frameworks provide vocabulary and decision criteria, but application requires judgment about the specific situation.

### The Human Element

Despite all the systematic processes, the underlying challenge remains fundamentally human:

> "Developing innovative products at scale would be super easy if it was one human working with a million robots... But one of the main reasons why this is hard is because we all work with groups of humans."

The processes work not by eliminating human judgment but by:
- Creating **shared vocabulary** for discussing tradeoffs
- Establishing **explicit decision points** where alignment can be verified
- Building **documentation practices** that preserve context over time
- Developing **escalation norms** that maintain trust under pressure
- Cultivating **feedback cultures** where coaching replaces criticism

---

## Action Items (Deduplicated)

### Before Starting Any Big Bet

**Conviction Building**:
- [ ] Document hypotheses for user profile, problem, and solution before research
- [ ] Define ideal customer with 2-3 key attributes (demographic, psychographic, position)
- [ ] Identify problem areas (CCFA) and hypothesize rank order
- [ ] Classify problem severity (vegetable/vitamin/painkiller)
- [ ] Conduct 10-30 long-form interviews using structured categories
- [ ] Run takeaway conversations—ask for real commitment, not soft yes
- [ ] Build low-fidelity conceptual prototype
- [ ] Test prototype with 10-30 users, looking for understanding AND delight
- [ ] Build lo-fi model with defined narrative and 2-3 year time horizon
- [ ] Use Fermi decomposition: anchor on known data, adjust for specifics
- [ ] Identify 2-3 critical assumptions that disproportionately affect impact
- [ ] Ensure product and engineering leaders develop independent recommendations

**Planning**:
- [ ] Build Work Breakdown Structure bottom-up—don't fit work to dates
- [ ] Include non-technical and launch-readiness work in WBS
- [ ] Document all assumptions explicitly
- [ ] Use t-shirt sizing for complexity, then sense-check within each level
- [ ] Estimate resource-time using appropriate baseline units
- [ ] Identify long poles and dependency teams early
- [ ] Set meaningful milestones at increasing fidelity levels
- [ ] Identify interim outputs that integrate work from multiple teams

### During Development

**Alignment & Execution**:
- [ ] Conduct kick-off covering Why (customer + business value), What (prototype), How (delivery plan)
- [ ] Synthesize 3-5 development themes for memory and recall
- [ ] Establish product review rhythm appropriate to blow-up risks
- [ ] Match deliverable fidelity to feedback level needed
- [ ] Clarify feedback type as given (command/suggestion/idea)
- [ ] Assign note-taker; share notes with stakeholders
- [ ] Maintain change log of strategic decisions
- [ ] Delegate detail work to core team members with clear context
- [ ] Build alignment with dependency teams on outputs and dates

**Risk Mitigation**:
- [ ] Add meta-tasks to validate critical assumptions
- [ ] Front-load work that can reduce late-stage complexity
- [ ] Pressure test failure states (performance, logic, security) early
- [ ] Make tradeoff decisions early—don't defer to end of project

### Launch Preparation

- [ ] Rebaseline hypotheses—document drift from kick-off
- [ ] Build burndown list with Blocker/Critical/Non-Critical categories
- [ ] Monitor capacity (alert at 90%+)
- [ ] Create runbooks for all impacted teams (marketing, CS, sales, success)
- [ ] Coordinate with third parties (identify POC, share runbooks)
- [ ] Schedule war room for launch day
- [ ] Define staging strategy (% users, segments, platforms)
- [ ] Define input and output metrics
- [ ] Build instrumentation for new actions, classification, user states
- [ ] Create communication plan for core team, dependency teams, executives
- [ ] Map potential failure modes with severity/difficulty assessment
- [ ] Pre-plan corrective strategies with triggers

### Post-Launch

- [ ] Execute communication plan at defined cadences
- [ ] Monitor input metrics against expectations
- [ ] Track qualitative feedback volume and sentiment
- [ ] Assess life raft metric impact
- [ ] Determine which gear you're shifting into (Accelerate/Improve/Restart/Wind Down)
- [ ] Adjust backlog priorities for the identified gear
- [ ] Schedule retrospective for 2-4 weeks post-launch
- [ ] Bring change log and development themes to retrospective
- [ ] Create implementation plan for key learnings

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

### What This Framework Doesn't Cover

1. **Strategic assessment and idea generation**: Focuses on delivery after ideas exist, not finding ideas
2. **Quick wins and feature work**: Systems designed for big bets; sustaining innovations use shorter cycles
3. **Very early-stage startups**: Assumes scaling company with exec layer and multiple teams
4. **Copy-paste solutions**: Everything requires customization to context
5. **Remote/distributed teams**: Examples assume co-located or hybrid with in-person reviews
6. **Cultural transformation**: Assumes ability to implement processes; doesn't address resistance
7. **Tool specifics**: Process-agnostic; no specific tool recommendations
8. **Cross-company dependencies**: When multiple companies must coordinate
9. **Failure recovery**: Focus on prevention; limited guidance on recovering from blow-ups already occurred
10. **Quantitative measures**: No metrics for assessing whether processes are working effectively

### Framework Assumptions to Test

- "Go slow to go fast" assumes conviction time is shorter than failed product time
- Takeaway conversation effectiveness depends on ability to ask for meaningful commitment
- Lo-fi model accuracy depends on quality of anchor data available
- Product review value assumes exec team engagement and follow-through
- Clean escalation culture requires leadership commitment to refuse disorganized escalations

### Philosophy & Approach

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "When startups are small, they invest in engineering processes... Though they have these robust systems for iterative improvements, they lack robust systems to deliver the next big thing." | Andy Johns |
| "Your best idea that never makes it to market means nothing to your customer, to your company, and ultimately to your career." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Great teams know that they have to go slow to go fast. The best thing you can do to make products ship faster is know when to slow down and make sure you get all the right information." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." | Elon Musk |
| "Developing innovative products at scale would be super easy if it was one human working with a million robots... But one of the main reasons why this is hard is because we all work with groups of humans." | Matt Greenberg |

### Customer & Problem Understanding

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "Product leaders often have an idea about what to build and just go build it, without first thinking about who they're building it for." | Andy Johns |
| "The most common mistake Product Leaders make is assuming all problems are painkiller problems. The truth is that most problems are low-grade, unworthy of a multi-month effort." | Course |
| "It's easy for the customer to tell you 'Yeah, sure, sure. Go build that thing,' because they don't want to offend you." | Andy Johns |
| "People are good at hearing what they want in user interviews. They are eager to hear that users want their solution. The truth is everybody wants everything until they have to pay for it." | Matt Greenberg |
| "If you haven't lost a few customers by the end of the takeaway exercise, because you made them uncomfortable with your persistence... you are not doing this portion of the process correctly. The truth is discovered uncomfortably." | Andy Johns |

### Prototypes & Delight

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "It's really difficult to have a successful kick-off meeting for a new product without having something tangible that shows your team the vision for the product you want to build." | Andy Johns |
| "There's a big difference between users who say, 'Ah I see, this is a productivity product' and those who express delight, like: 'Wow, when can I start using this!?'" | Andy Johns |
| "If users understand what you're building, and express zero emotion or enthusiasm for it, that should be a leading indicator that you might be proposing a solution to a low-grade problem." | Andy Johns |

### Planning & Estimation

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "Over the last 10+ years we've seen an overreliance on the orthodoxy of quick, iterative shipping in the religion of 'lean development' and Agile." | Andy Johns |
| "A lot of people start with top-down work plans—they pick key delivery dates and fit the workplan to make those dates. However, this often results in teams developing unrealistic plans from the get-go." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Very rarely does the first version meet the quality bar necessary to truly delight customers." | Andy Johns |
| "Often people are optimizing their initial estimates for project approval. At this stage you should optimize for the most realistic estimates for delivering the scope." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Status updates are meaningless to me. I'd much rather see the progress demonstrated in a functional output than hear that the work is 'green.'" | Matt Greenberg |
| "Any time product development requires integration with a 3rd party, the 3rd party requirements are the long pole dependency in the project." | Matt Greenberg |

### Alignment & Blow-Ups

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "The best way to screw up a project at this stage is to be in opposition at the start. That opposition compounds and dooms the project." | Matt Greenberg |
| "When late-stage blow-ups happen, it's devastating to the team, the company, and your customers." | Andy Johns |
| "If a team is building the right thing, but they say something is 12 weeks of work and it's actually 16, then it's not the end of the world. However, if the opposite is true... the implications are pretty disastrous." | Matt Greenberg |
| "A 10% difference in assumption matters at the beginning. Everyone goes off to make hundreds of decisions after that point based on slightly different rubrics." | Matt Greenberg |
| "I frequently come across wounded PMs that no longer want the execs involved in the development process because of late-stage blow-ups, but the ironic solution to that problem is a recurring product review." | Andy Johns |

### Delegation & Tradeoffs

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "Leaders who get too deep in the details tend to break their brain. It's too much for one person to know and stay on top of as things inevitably change." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Compromise is making no one more unhappy than they can tolerate being. The right plan makes everyone disappointed, but not to their breaking point." | Matt Greenberg |
| "MVP is not the easiest thing for you to ship and still solve the problem—instead it's the minimum needed to deliver at least one form of customer delight." | Andy Johns |
| "A big difference between senior and junior leaders is in their ability to find simple solutions that generate moments of delight." | Andy Johns |
| "Most often, it's better to have one premium experience for your most important user than a few average experiences." | Matt Greenberg |

### Kick-Offs & Reviews

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "At Wealthfront, Kick-Off is where we started our product development process, because the single largest development problem we were experiencing was that product teams would get to the tail end of development and then execs would come in and blow the thing up." | Andy Johns |
| "A strong understanding of who you're building for and what problem you're trying to solve for them is the first step to ensuring the team will be aligned on the next 100 decisions after Kick-Off." | Andy Johns |
| "A great 'why' story is well synthesized, with clear and concise language that's easy to repeat. It highlights themes." | Matt Greenberg |
| "I think about reviews as an opportunity to clear the road so my teams can keep moving quickly." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Consider the zoom on a camera. If you want the viewer to focus on the lighting in the landscape, you wouldn't give them a photo zoomed in on the flower." | Fareed Mosavat |
| "The person who takes notes has the power. They shape the narrative of the meeting." | Matt Greenberg |

### Team Dynamics & Intervention

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "On my teams we use the principle 'share what matters.' Be concise and intentional about what this audience needs to understand to help solve your problem." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Allowing teams to bring their best work to a solution they believe in wholeheartedly but takes them slightly off course is okay, because they'll travel further on the thing they believe in than the directive you give them." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Sometimes people don't have the skillset or capability to solve the problem, and no amount of coaching will get them there." | Andy Johns |
| "Over time, teams will appreciate a climate of clean escalations, as it reduces the feeling of politics and drama." | Matt Greenberg |

### Launch & Post-Launch

| Quote | Source |
|-------|--------|
| "Launching a big bet is like filing for an IPO. You need to prepare for the actual event, but you also need to have a plan for what comes after it." | Andy Johns |
| "You need to use your judgment when trying to push a team to work unsustainably. It rarely works out to take out a mortgage against your future." | Matt Greenberg |
| "When faced with a choice between A and B, leaders want a way out... Choosing both at this stage often costs you both." | Matt Greenberg |
| "Under conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help, they are required for success." | Atul Gawande |
| "A good baseline metric for complaints is that twenty times the number of users have a problem than file a ticket about it." | Andy Johns |
| "Product market fit doesn't feel like vague idle interest... It really feels like everything in your business has gone totally haywire." | Peter Reinhardt |
| "It's often clear what to do when there's a home run. And it's clear what to do when there's a strikeout. But there's a lot of complexity in the ambiguous zone." | Matt Greenberg |
