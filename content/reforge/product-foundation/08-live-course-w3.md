## Executive Summary

This session focuses on the **execution phase** of product development—the "build" stage where PMs often feel they have the least direct responsibility but where stakeholder management and risk mitigation become critical. Jess brings deep experience from Slack's hypergrowth era, having led both the Identity team (technical infrastructure) and the Core Product team (channels, notifications, emoji, threads—65% of the codebase with 20% of engineering).

The core thesis: **Your job as a PM is to manage risk through storytelling and leverage creation.** In execution, this means proactively communicating value (not just deliverables), building advocates who amplify your narrative when you're not in the room, and helping your team feel connected to outcomes rather than tickets. The most successful PMs operate with radical acceptance of chaos while maintaining an appearance of control—asking for help in ways that build trust rather than signal weakness.

Two case studies illustrate the spectrum: the Identity team was invisible and undervalued despite critical work; the Core Product team was hyper-visible and constantly interrupted. Both required the same fundamental approach—offense over defense, milestones that create momentum, and deep empathy for what stakeholders actually care about.

## 1. Stakeholder Management & Buy-In

### The "Not My Fault, But My Problem" Framework
**Source:** Annie Pearl (mentor to both Jess and JZ)

The defining PM mindset: you own the outcome regardless of whether you control all the inputs.

> "It's not my fault, but it is my problem."

**Application:**
- If you don't have the team you need → your fault for not articulating it
- If stakeholders don't understand your work → your fault for not telling the story
- If engineering is blocked → your problem to unblock

### Three Stakeholders That Matter
At all times, identify **three stakeholders** who have outsized influence on perception of your work:

1. Someone with technical credibility (CTO, senior engineer)
2. Someone who feels customer pain directly (Head of Support, Sales)
3. Someone in rooms you won't be in (executive sponsor)

> "Instead of telling everyone every technical detail, I told the two people who mattered every detail. And they then could be the amplifiers to our work."

**Jess's Identity Team Example:**
- CTO: invested in engineering productivity and architecture
- Head of Customer Support (Ali Rail): pissed about incidents and tickets, had ton of influence
- Both became evangelists without Jess having to be everywhere

### Bringing Stakeholders Into the Build
> "People only believe in something they have a hand in building."

**Tactics:**
- **$100 voting exercise**: Stakeholders allocate hypothetical budget across features—creates ownership
- **Early office hours**: Multiple sessions on problem statement before solutioning
- **Read-back technique**: Interview stakeholders first, then reflect their priorities back when presenting solutions

### Understanding Executive Context
From chief of staff experience:

> "When they are talking to you about this thing that you spend all your time thinking about, they have thought about it for approximately the time of your meeting, and that's it."

**Implications:**
- Put yourself in their holistic purview, not just your area
- Make it easy for them to look good (board meetings, staff meetings)
- Brief is better—some want one sentence, others want depth; read the room

---

## 2. Storytelling & Communication

### Storytelling as the Core PM Skill
> "If I would work on any core skill, especially if you wanna advance in your career, it is storytelling."

**Components:**
- Understanding your audience's incentives
- Making others look good through your work
- Adapting format to the person (metrics-oriented vs. human-oriented vs. technical)

### The Road Map as a Story
Jess's initial mistake with the Identity team:

> "A road map is a story... The road map was anchored on the what, not necessarily on the why."

**Wrong approach:** List of technical improvements (fix schema, increase observability, build support tools)

**Right approach:**
- Connect to what stakeholders care about
- Show what it **unlocks** long-term
- Frame as theory of change: "Doing X enables Y which achieves Z"

### Three Customer Stories Rule
> "You cannot write a spec. You cannot make a pitch. You should not have a conversation with anyone in your organization without a real customer story at hand."

Jess keeps **three customer stories** ready for every meeting:
- "I just talked to so-and-so, and they said..."
- "I just read this report, and I validated it with this customer..."

### Closing the Loop (24-Hour Rule)
After executive feedback:

> "The best PMs circle back within twenty-four hours... to say: what I heard, here's what we're doing about it, in the briefest, most direct way."

**Anti-pattern:** Getting defensive in the meeting, then disappearing. Executives wonder "what happened?"

### Multiple Storytelling Modes
Different stakeholders need different stories:
- **Metrics-oriented**: Cost avoidance, ticket reduction, incident minutes
- **Human-oriented**: Customer pain, frustration quotes
- **Technical**: Engineering productivity, architecture improvements

> "You have to have all those angles of your story."

---

## 3. Team Dynamics & Culture

### Sprint Planning Reframe
Move from ticket-oriented (Jira) to goal-oriented (doc-based):

> "What are the goals that we're trying to accomplish this sprint? And have we met that goal?"

**Benefits:**
- Engineers feel connected to outcomes, not tickets
- "Tiny OKRs" create belonging to results
- PMs become outcome drivers, not ticket movers

**Example framing:** "We're trying to get a working prototype for users to test" vs. "Complete tickets 1-47"

### Reading Back Customer Feedback
Start sprint planning by sharing what customers actually thought about previous work:
- Creates direct line between engineering effort and user impact
- Motivating for team members who rarely hear from customers

### Business Context as Motivation
> "Engineers often don't ask for the business context... but if they get it, it's motivating."

Give the **theory of change**: "Hooking up these two systems will allow us to move the entire project forward and get to that customer outcome."

### Co-Building Road Maps
For technical initiatives, build the road map **with** engineering:

> "I made a road map... I worked side by side with engineering to say, what actually has to get tackled in what order."

**Result:** Team dynamics were strong—everyone felt ownership. The failure was external storytelling, not internal alignment.

### Hiring for Culture Fit
For high-interrupt teams (core product, platform):

> "We had to hire for that. For a degree of just like, okay. Well, here we go again. A culture of interop, a culture of helping other teams."

Some engineers won't thrive in chaos—let them move to teams with more certainty.

---

## 4. Execution & Milestones

### Milestones Create Momentum
For long-term projects:

> "In a really long term project... if you hit milestones, everyone's like, oh, well, we hit M1. Isn't that great? And you're like, M1 was fucking made up. I thought of it while I was in the shower."

**Why milestones matter:**
- Sense of progress for the team
- Story of continuous improvement for stakeholders
- Data on actual velocity vs. planned velocity

### Playing Offense vs. Defense
**Defense:** Reacting to manager feedback, user complaints, other team requests

**Offense:** Proactively communicating value, setting the narrative, choosing where to invest

> "Start with how do I go on the offensive to make sure that I am communicating. I am the tip of the spear."

You can't avoid some defense, but if you're *only* playing defense:
- Team appears reactive
- No perceived forward progress
- Value delivery stalls

### Slow Down to Speed Up (Platform Teams)
Platform work requires invisible foundational fixes before visible features:

> "When you are slowing down... they're like, well, what are you doing? They only see the tip of the iceberg."

**Solution:** Make the iceberg visible through metrics:
- Incidents down
- Support tickets reduced
- Engineering velocity improved

### Reserving Capacity for Reality
Core Product decision:

> "We have to reserve 40-60% of our time for that work [incidents, tickets, other team support]."

Accept and communicate that interrupt-driven work is part of the job, not a failure of planning.

### The Customer Love Sprint
For craft and quality at scale:

**Structure:**
- Entire team (60 people) for two weeks
- List of possible projects engineers choose from
- Only rule: must ship something
- CEO/CPO judged, awards given, company-wide celebration

> "We took this part of the CEO's vision and made it part of who we were as a team, made it part of our DNA."

---

## 5. Trust Building

### The Trust Framework
Trust = **Competence + Reliability + Motive**

**Application to team management:**
- **Competence**: Does the organization believe we can do this?
- **Reliability**: Do we deliver when we say we will? (CEO Papercuts channel created reliability loop)
- **Motive**: Are we aligned on what we're trying to achieve?

> "If you were to rate your trust with any colleague... how do I feel about this person's competence, their reliability, and their motive?"

### CEO Papercuts Channel
Creating trust with a demanding executive:

**Problem:** CEO would go directly to engineers for fixes, bypassing process

**Solution:** Private "CEO Papercuts" channel
- CEO reports issues there instead of direct pings
- Weekly report back: "We're not gonna fix this one because XYZ. We are gonna fix this one—here's the delivery date."

> "We'd accept your feedback. We love your feedback. You're good at this. And we're gonna do something about it."

### Asking for Help Without Losing Control
> "You can ask for help in a way that still imbues confidence in your leadership."

**Anti-pattern (from Annie Pearl):** When asked a question you don't know, saying "I don't know, what do you think?"

**Better:** "That's a really interesting question. Let me think about it and get back to you."

Or: "How are you thinking about that problem?" (buys time while showing engagement)

> "Kids do not want to feel out of control. That's very destabilizing, and it's destabilizing to humans and definitely to engineers."

### Vulnerability as Strength
> "I went to engineering, and I was like, listen. Here's the perception in the org, especially in product. I need your help in defining the metrics, in defining the outcomes."

Being vulnerable about external pressure invited collaboration → tech lead got promoted from the work that resulted.

### Feedback Week Ritual
First 1:1 of every month is 45-minute bidirectional feedback session:

> "You have to give bidirectional feedback. It just ritualizes it."

Extend this to peer relationships (EMs, cross-functional partners).

## 6. Platform/Core Product Leadership

### The Visibility Spectrum

| Situation | Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Identity Team (invisible) | No one cares, work undervalued | Make it important through storytelling |
| Core Product (hyper-visible) | Everyone has opinions, constant interrupts | Proactive narrative, radical acceptance |

### Making Invisible Work Visible
**Code name strategy:** Give technical projects memorable names so non-technical stakeholders can track them

**Metrics strategy:**
- Services owned vs. engineering headcount (65% of codebase, 20% of engineers)
- Incident minutes reduced
- Support tickets resolved
- Customer-impacting time avoided

### Radical Acceptance for Core Teams
> "It is my dream to work on Slack's core product. It is my dream to affect this many millions of users. And because of that, it comes with costs."

Reframe interrupts as features of the role, not bugs:
- Centrality = influence
- Visibility = impact
- Chaos = opportunity

> "We are going to spend six months on different parts of that product, and then we'll shift teams to new parts."

Acknowledge you can't roadmap everything at once—be explicit about rotation.

### Dealing with Executive Product Founders
On working with Stewart Butterfield (Slack CEO, former Flickr founder):

> "He was not gonna change. He was not gonna change how he thought about product."

If you respect and enjoy working for that person → figure out how to serve their vision
If you don't → leave

### Self-Service and Documentation
For teams everyone depends on:

> "Creating self-service... documentation is a big part of that tooling. But also just like, yes. Please ask me for our code review. Yes. Please ask me for help."

Shift from "us vs. them" to "we serve the org."

---

## 7. PM Career & Identity

### Thriving in Chaos
> "PMs that I know thrive in chaos, and weirdly want control. It's this duality that's very odd."

PM is not a flow-state job:

> "PMs never get to flow state the way that other functions do... The PM's job typically does not get into flow state."

If you crave flow state → consider whether PM is right for you.

### Finding Your Zone of Genius
> "Find the things that you really love doing. Understand the things you really hate doing, and then create workflows that really amplify the things that you're great at."

Don't force yourself into stereotypical PM behaviors:
- Not great at public speaking? → Lean into written communication, async video
- Need prep time? → Pre-work conversations before meetings

### The Flagship Win Rule
> "You need a flagship win every six months. And everything else has to fall by the wayside other than that flagship win."

Focus creates clarity for you and legibility for stakeholders.

### Emotional Intelligence as Superpower
On the pressure to lead "like a man":

> "I feel very feminine in a lot of my qualities... it has taken me a while to really accept that was actually a superpower."

Feedback like "you giggle too much" or "you're too friendly" was wrong:

> "The thing that makes me a superhero is my kindness and my care for people. And because I have kindness and care, I can ask them to do huge and impossible things."

### Enneagram Insight
Jess identifies as 2 wing 3 ("The Hostess"):
- **2**: People person, wants others to feel good
- **3**: Achiever, wants things to be perfect

> "You're kind of Type A and controlling and rigid. But you want everyone to feel good. That's exactly what PM is—it's chaos, but you figure it out, and it has to be perfect."

### Chief of Staff as PM Training
Benefits:
- See executive decision-making up close
- Build relationships across the organization
- Practice truth-telling and synthesis

Limitations:
- Not building
- Not the decision maker
- "I could make recommendations... but I wasn't the one making the call."

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

1. **Company stage bias**: Examples are from hypergrowth Slack—may not translate to early-stage or mature enterprise
2. **Founder-led specificity**: CEO Papercuts approach assumes engaged, opinionated founder; different dynamic with professional CEO
3. **Technical depth**: No discussion of how non-technical PMs build credibility on technical decisions (mentioned using ChatGPT/Claude now)
4. **Metrics depth**: Acknowledged her team "was not very good at burn downs or understanding capacity vs. delivery"
5. **Remote/hybrid**: All examples seem to assume co-located teams ("back when we stood up in a circle")
