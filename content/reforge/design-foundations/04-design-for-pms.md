PM/Designer
Relationship Assessment
Take a minute to think through and answer each of these questions
on your own (these go from basic to aspirational):
Do you have regular 1:1s with your designer?
Do you know what your designer is currently excited about?
Do you know what your designer is currently worried about?
Do you agree on priorities with your designer?
Does your designer mostly honor the scope you’ve identified for
projects?
Does your designer pitch bold ideas when there’s room for
them?
Are you usually excited about 1:1s and collaboration sessions
with your designer?
Do you feel comfortable discussing things far into the roadmap
with them?
Are you comfortable having your designer present to senior
leaders on behalf of your team?
If you don’t have any Nos, you win!
If you have any Nos, there’s work to be done on your relationship.

PM/Designer
Communication
Checklist
To ensure you’re communicating properly with your designer, verify
you’re doing these things:
Hold weekly 1:1s with your design partner
Hold recurring meetings where your Engineering Leader,
Designer and you are present
Give your designer a chance to comment on any documents
which represent the team before sharing, especially with
leadership
Give your designer a heads up whenever you are considering big
projects/initiatives, even before it’s something tangible with
expected deliverables
Immediately communicate changes in product strategy to your
designer
Immediately communicate changes in project scope to your
designer
Ask to be immediately informed of potentially disruptive
feedback coming from design reviews
Ask to be kept up-to-date on the evolution of projects, especially
if things are taking longer than necessary

Design for PMs: the Workbook 5
Practices for Building
Shared Understanding
To be productive at all as a team, you need to establish clear,
out-in-the-open understanding of your customer, their problems,
their context and the environment in which you’re operating. Use
these practices to accomplish that:
Practice Purpose
Attend user research
sessions together
In a B2C context, research may be more design-driven,
or more product-driven in a B2B setting. In any case,
hearing from users directly (and ideally asking them
questions directly) established bedrock upon which to
build shared understanding.
Debrief on learnings from
research and analysis
together
Even when hearing directly from customers,
interpretations may be different, or you may pick up
different nuances than your designer. Debriefing
together, immediately after a call, allows you to share
notes and increase coverage.
Write down key
opportunities/problems to
solve
By distilling learnings into a co-authored synthesis,
you’ll have no option but to identify what matters most,
and to express it in language you can both reference
later. This makes designing and evaluating designs a lot
easier later.
Convey the why behind
technical constraints to
scope
While not all PMs are technical, the share of
technically-oriented designers is even lower. For them,
technical constraints can seem arbitrary and/or vague,
unmovable hurdles. By contextualizing what’s shaping
technical constraints with more detail, the designer can
develop instincts about where to push explorations
without growing scope.

Design for PMs: the Workbook 6
Checklists for
kick-starting new
relationships
1. If they’re new to the team and you’re not
In this context, you’re already doing 60 on a freeway (or 120, if
you’re metric), and they’re ramping up, while getting to know the
product, the strategy and/or the team. Getting them up to speed is
the priority, mostly through transfer of knowledge.
Set up weekly 1:1s
Introduce the designer to the team in your first team meeting,
and give them a chance to introduce themselves.
Prepare and share a document with all relevant context you
think they need to understand the basics of your product (users,
goals, history) and your plans (goals, strategy, constraints). This
can be bullet points to then cover verbally or extensive notes for
self-reading, what matters is mapping out relevant knowledge.
Give them a verbal tour of who’s who on the team, what you’ve
learned about working with them, and each person’s particular
strengths (eg Amy is great for sanity checking backend
complexity, Andy is super quick in prototyping iOS interactions).
In your first 1:1, work together to write down your understanding
of your separate and shared responsibilities and what’s currently
top of mind for you.
Check in often with them (every couple of days) in the first few
weeks, to see if they have any questions

Checklists for

relationships
2. If you’re new to the team and they’re not
In this context, the designer will have more insight into the product
and the team than you, and potentially on pre-existing strategy.
Pulling from them so you can get up-to-speed faster is the name of
the game, while identifying gaps they may have from not being in the
PM seat.
Set up weekly 1:1s
In your first 1:1, work together to write down your understanding
of your separate and shared responsibilities
Prepare a doc with questions for the most important things for
you to know about the product and team, and use their help to
find answers in your first few weeks. Make sure to include:
What had been working well vs not process-wise until
you joined
What are the team’s strengths and weaknesses as a whole
What the team is excited and concerned about as a whole
As you start to shape a plan and define a strategy, get the
designer’s very early input so you can catch incorrect
assumptions or things which have already been tried

Checklists for
kick-starting new
relationships
3. If you’re both new to the team
This is the least ideal situation, since it means it’s either something
entirely new or there was significant breakdown to lead to this. In
this context, you’ll have to lean on each other and pull a lot from
leadership to get the context you need to get going.
Set up weekly 1:1s
In your first 1:1, work together to write down your understanding
of your separate and shared responsibilities
Exchange notes on what you know so far about the product and
the team
Prepare a shared doc with questions for the most important
things for you two to know about the product and team and
collaboratively add and discuss the answers you get. Pull a lot
from leadership (product and design) for these, as well from your
engineering peers.

Design for PMs: the Workbook 9
When to Involve
Your Designer
While you should always try to involve your designer as early as
possible (or at least keep them up-to-date with what's happening),
you can use the Four Risks Model to find reasonable bounds for
when it may be too early or too late:
Type of Risk Timing
Mainly value or business risk OK to wait until key aspects of the model are validated
Mainly feasibility risk OK to wait until the basic technical assessment is
complete (except if the technical path is highly
determined by the UX).
Mainly usability risk Any delay in involving design can be costly. Projects
like this may even require early explorations before
making it into the roadmap.

Practices for
Establishing Context
Tactically
Use these as a quick reference when discussing projects.
Practice How it works Good for
Clarify goal types Discern between strategic
goals, short term fixes,
learning-oriented projects
Focusing design effort and sizing
up solutions according to their
importance and expected
longevity
Provide visibility
into sequencing
Outline what you have
planned after this current
project, and how multiple
projects build up to
something
Preventing designers from
stuffing too much into a given
project, by assuring they’ll have a
chance to iterate on the area at
hand.
Emphasize what
matters most
Clarify what’s absolutely
needed or most
challenging in a project
Ensuring most design brain cycles
go towards the parts of higher
returns, and not on less important
details
State your
appetite
Express in units of time
how much do you think it’s
worth investing in a given
project, and why.
Preventing design explorations for
going on for too long for
something not worthwhile.
Clarify what’s
shaping the scope
Contextualize what’s
causing the scope to be
constrained
Ensuring designers don’t see
scope lines as arbitrary, but
instead internalize and work with
them (and not against them)
Make sure you’ve
been understood
Create surface area for
questions and ensure your
points are clear
Catching potential
misunderstandings

Design for PMs: the Workbook 11
Techniques for Ensuring
Understanding
Technique How it works Why it Works
Playing it
Back
When discussing a project with
your designer, especially for the
first time, ask them to
summarize the reasons for it and
its goals, in their own words,
informally.
Don’t make it feel like a test, but
like a conversation. For larger
projects where there’s more to
internalize, it can take a written
form and be called a “Reverse
Brief”
When anyone explains something
in their own words, they have to
internalize it, establish their own
mental model, and then use
words which are natural to them
to get it across. So if anything isn’t
understood, it surfaces questions;
and if it’s misunderstood, it
creates surface area for
adjustments.
The Open
Questions
Section
Make sure to leave a section in
your docs (PRDs, strategy docs,
etc) for open questions to which
the designer (or anyone else) can
add.
Don’t remove them until you’re
sure they’ve been clearly
answered, which involves
checking with who added it.
Different from just leaving
comments on a doc or asking
questions during a meeting, the
open questions section becomes
a forcing function for answers to
be provided. It makes it harder for
designers to progress while still
uncertain, and act as a reminder
for you, as the PM, to provide
answers.

Design for PMs: the Workbook 12
Objective Criteria for
Design Evaluation
When disagreeing with a designer’s solution see if the causes for
disagreement center on any of these criteria. If yes, they can be
objectively assessed, it’s not, it’s subjective, and it may be best to
just trust your designer.
Quality Criterion How to assess it objectively
Does it meet our goals? Run through the stated goals for the project and
evaluate if the solution has enough likelihood of
meeting them
Does it fit with the overall
product?
Compare it against published
standards/guidelines/design systems .
Find similar contexts elsewhere in the product and
evaluate if are cohesive enough
Is it understandable by the
people who’ll use it?
Get user feedback or an agreed upon reliable proxy
Is it technically feasible with
the resourcing/timeframes
we have allotted to it?
Get engineering estimates and suggestions for
simplification
Does it get in the way of
future planned projects?
Run this against your team’s (and relevant team’s)
roadmaps, looking for projects which may touch this
flow in the future and require significant changes

Adapting When You
Don’t Have a Dedicated
Design Partner
1. If you’re “sharing” the bandwidth of a designer with other teams
When in this model:
Understand from the designer how much of their bandwidth you can
count on, so you can adjust your plans accordingly and use their time for
the hardest or most valuable projects.
Schedule recurring 1:1s, even if they can’t be weekly (any cadence
helps). When the designer is caught up with projects from other teams,
you can use the time to update them on progress on your side.
Put effort into writing briefs with fewer assumptions about context,
especially if the designer can’t attend your team meetings.
Pay extra attention to see if you’ve been understood in live kick-off
sessions (don’t risk going async)
Work with the designer to establish a cadence of sharing rounds for
feedback and delivery which works for both of you.
Make yourself particularly available to answer questions

Adapting When You
Don’t Have a Dedicated
Design Partner
2. If you’re working in a project-based service model, from a pool of
designers
When in this model:
Unfortunately but naturally de-emphasize relationship building
Put extra effort in writing a brief with few assumptions about context:
watch for intra-team jargon and shorthands, explicitly connect the
project to previous and future ones which may be relevant. Don’t
assume anything is obvious.
Have a live kick-off session (don’t risk going async), and make sure
you’re understood.
Ask if the designer would be open to quick (15-30 min) regular
meetings throughout the duration of the project. Getting those on the
calendar creates a good forcing function and opportunities to check in.
