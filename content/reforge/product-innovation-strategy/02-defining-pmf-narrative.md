## Executive Summary

The PMF narrative is a dynamic document that encapsulates product strategy hypotheses along six dimensions: problem to solve, target audience, value proposition, competitive advantage, growth strategy, and business model. These dimensions directly address the six most common reasons new products fail.

The core thesis challenges the lean startup mentality of "hurry and build." Sachin Rekhi learned this through Anywhere.FM, a music streaming service that achieved 100K users but failed due to unexamined business model assumptions—specifically, legal storage costs and willingness to pay. The lesson: "The best way to build initially is not actually to build. Rather, we should first define and document our product strategy."

The methodology provides specific frameworks for each dimension: the outcome-motivation-gap approach for problem discovery, sequenced Now/Future markets for target audience, the ideal homepage approach for value proposition, Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers for competitive advantage, dual-channel strategy for growth, and business equations for the business model. Throughout, LinkedIn Sales Navigator serves as the detailed implementation example.

When executed well, "this document becomes a blueprint of what a successful product looks like. We've addressed all six failure modes to figure out not only how not to fail, but also how to thrive."

---

## 1. Why Product Strategy Matters

### The "Hurry and Build" Trap

The overarching problem is that product builders view building a product strategy document as a quick formality, overlooking its potential value for PMF success. We either fill it out as quickly as possible, or just go off a version inside our heads.

**Root cause:** The lean startup methodology emphasizes building an MVP as soon as possible. It even advocates that the business model canvas "can be done in as little as 15 minutes."

**Consequence:** When we rush to build—and when we assume that we'll create the product strategy as needed—we can end up building a product that people want, but still fail.

### The Anywhere.FM Lesson

Sachin Rekhi's pre-streaming music service allowed users to upload their entire music collection and listen anywhere without carrying an iPod. The team:
- Identified an acute problem
- Built a resonant value proposition
- Gathered 100K users within months
- Built a product people loved

**Two fatal assumptions discovered too late:**

1. **Storage cost assumption:** They assumed they could store only one version of the same song across users. But this had become illegal—if 100 users owned the same song, they had to pay to store it 100 times.

2. **Monetization assumption:** They assumed they could monetize purely with ads. When storage costs mounted, they had to charge $10/month—ill-received in a pre-streaming era where competitors were free.

### The PMF Narrative as Blueprint

The PMF narrative tool has six dimensions that address the six most common reasons why new products fail:

| Dimension | Common Failure Mode |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Problem to Solve | Problem wasn't acute enough |
| Target Audience | Market size ill-defined (too broad or too small) |
| Value Proposition | Solution doesn't resonate with customers |
| Competitive Advantage | Not meaningfully differentiated from competition |
| Growth Strategy | Lacks sustainable long-term growth strategy |
| Business Model | Fails to prove profitability |

**Key benefit:** Validation becomes targeted and deep, based on the degree of risk believed. This allows for concerted bets without testing every dimension—and gives each test more time and space to prove successful.

> — Sachin Rekhi

## 2. Initial Insight Validation

### The Starting Point

The starting point for a successful PMF narrative is an initial insight—a "seed of an idea" that can be developed into a fully-formed PMF narrative.

> "It's important to pressure test if your initial insight is good—if your initial insight is off by a degree, then you're completely in the wrong place when you try to launch your product later on."
> — Sachin Rekhi

### Three Characteristics of Good Initial Insights

#### 1. Earned

The best initial insights are justified by in-depth, personal experiences and observations. Good insights are rarely the result of a brainstorming exercise.

**Three valid sources:**
- **Lived experiences:** Directly from the product builder's professional and personal experiences
- **Emergent behaviors:** From deeply observing user behavior on existing products
- **Total immersion:** From time spent deeply immersed in a problem space—talking to customers or playing with existing solutions

#### 2. Unique

The initial insight should be under-appreciated, not something everyone believes. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, but it shouldn't be an obvious truth.

> "In order to create something legendary, you have to have an insight that is non-consensus but right."
> — Andy Rachleff

**Litmus test:** Mixed consensus when shared. If everyone loves the idea, it's an obvious truth and fails the unique test. If only 50% of people like it, that's actually a good thing.

#### 3. Grounded in at Least One PMF Dimension

Usually the "value proposition" dimension (common to come up with solution ideas), but can be any dimension. If not aligned to at least one dimension, there's no launching pad for the PMF narrative.

**For PMF expansion (established orgs):** At least one dimension should align with existing product strategy dimensions, with the goal being multiple dimensions.

> "Why is our organization better equipped to do this than anyone else?"
> — Fareed Mosavat, Chief Development Officer at Reforge

### Example: Opendoor

**Initial insight:** "People traditionally have viewed buying homes in the same way as buying fine art; it can't be done online. But homes are much more like a commodity than people intuit."

| Characteristic | How It's Met |
|---------------|--------------|
| Earned | Co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu had previously founded Movity, another real estate startup |
| Unique | At the time, many believed homes couldn't be sold online due to neighborhood knowledge and quality assessment |
| Grounded | Value proposition dimension—leverage data to automatically price homes, enabling quick sales without traditional hassle |

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Initial insight:** "We have incredible member profile and connection data from LinkedIn that we can use to create a radically different selling process for sales professionals."

| Characteristic | How It's Met |
|---------------|--------------|
| Earned | From deeply observing user behavior—sales reps were already using InMail to message prospective leads |
| Unique | Existing solutions weren't considering how to leverage such unique data for a radically different selling process |
| Grounded | Competitive advantage dimension—incredible member profile and connection data from existing LinkedIn product |

---

## 3. Problem to Solve

### The Solution Thinking Trap

Product builders tend to retrofit hypothesized problems to initial solution-focused insights. While this seems efficient, "solution thinking" leads to defining low-severity problems.

**Why this matters:** Many products fail despite solving a problem because the problem is low-severity. Unless it's a burning problem, the target audience won't care and won't adopt.

### The Outcome-Motivation-Gap Approach

A three-step process to unearth deep-rooted, burning problems:

**Step 1: Think of the Outcome**
Focus on the desired outcome for the customer, not the perceived solution. What are customers really trying to achieve?

**Step 2: Understand the Motivation**
Ponder the "why." Why do customers want this outcome?

**Step 3: Determine the Gaps**
What stands in the way of customers achieving their desired outcome immediately? Why can't they do this today? The gaps become the initial hypothesis for the problem to solve.

### Framing Problems Correctly

Problems must be framed as problems, not rephrased solutions:

| Correct (Problem) | Incorrect (Rephrased Solution) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Working professionals spend too much time scheduling meetings" | "Helping working professionals spend less time scheduling meetings" |

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**If trapped in solution thinking:** "Sales professionals waste too much time communicating with leads" → misses the forest for the trees, solving a low-severity quantity problem when the real burning problem was lead quality.

**Using outcome-motivation-gap:**

| Step | LSN Application |
|------|-----------------|
| Outcome | Sales professionals want to increase the quantity, size, and speed of closed deals |
| Motivation | Sales professionals work on commissions and want to maximize earnings |
| Gaps | 1. Challenging to identify the right prospects to reach out to |
| | 2. Difficult to determine the best path to reach them (majority of outreach is cold) |
| | 3. Often lack social context to craft compelling outreach messages |

---

## 4. Target Audience Sequencing

### The Large Market Trap

The most common mistake is defining the largest possible target audience—driven by feedback from investors and execs asking "Why aren't we targeting a larger market?"

**Reality:** We can't build a product from day one that satisfies all customers. Trying to go after too large a target audience leads to losing direction by building for all different kinds of customers.

### The LyftXL Lesson

Adam Fishman's team struggled to launch LyftXL because they tried to address two groups simultaneously:
- Passengers who needed a larger vehicle
- Passengers who wanted a premium experience

**Result:** Bought and retrofitted Ford Explorers, launched Lyft Plus. Hugely expensive and unsuccessful.

**Solution:** Simplified to just passengers who needed a larger vehicle, created XL car designation. Later expanded to premium experience seekers.

### The Sequenced Approach

The best route to winning a large market:
1. Initially tackle a deliberately chosen smaller market
2. Dominate that market
3. Expand to adjacent markets
4. Rinse and repeat

> "You're not a blunt instrument trying to chop into a market by being everything for everyone, but instead the sharp blade with extraordinary focus on a specific persona or use case to start."
> — Sarah Tavel, General Partner at Benchmark

### Evidence: Amazon and Salesforce

**Amazon's sequence:**
1. Books only
2. CDs, videos, software (adjacent)
3. Amazon Prime (new customer segments seeking fast delivery)
4. "The everything store"

**Salesforce's sequence:**
1. Sales and CRM solutions only
2. Marketing and Support & Service solutions
3. Analytics and integration solutions

### The Three-Step Process

**Step 1: Hypothesize Relevant Attributes**

Three categories of attributes:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Demographic | User characteristics (more relevant for B2C) | Age, gender, location, income, education, family size |
| Psychographic | Beliefs and values | Organization-focused vs. convenience-focused |
| Position | Organization/industry context (B2B) or consumer context (B2C) | Industry, company size, title, consumer budget, family role |

**Step 2: Group Attributes into Customer Segments**

Customer segments are collections of attributes wrapped into one customer profile. For B2B and marketplace products, define segments for each user role.

**Step 3: Separate into "Now" and "Future" Markets**

Prioritize customer segments that resonate most with other dimensions:
- Most acute problem to solve
- Strongest resonance with value prop
- Strongest competitive advantage
- Greatest ease of reach
- Strongest willingness to pay

> "It's OK for our initial target audience to be small, so long as the market is existent."
> — Sachin Rekhi

**Example:** Andy Johns at Wealthfront initially focused on single engineers at tech companies with large stock positions. Today: fintech service targeting financially-focused millennials.

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Key attributes hypothesized:**

| Attribute | Values | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| User title | Account executives, Account managers | AEs look for new accounts; AMs nurture existing |
| Industry | Tech, Financial services | Greatest density of sales prospects on LinkedIn |
| Deal size | >$100K (relationship sales), $10K-$100K (transactional) | Relationship = quality matters; Transactional = quantity matters |

**Customer segments for end users:** 8 segments (4 AE permutations + 4 AM permutations)
**Customer segments for decision makers:** 4 segments (VPs of Sales with permutations of industry and deal size)

**"Now" prioritization rationale:**
- Account executives over account managers: most acute pain in lacking high-quality leads
- Tech and financial services: higher LinkedIn presence (easier reach), builds on competitive advantage
- Higher deal sizes: translates to higher willingness to pay

> "It's not that we're never going after a large target audience. It's just not our initial goal, and that's more strategic in the long run."
> — Sachin Rekhi (to sponsoring executives)

## 5. Value Proposition Design

### The Features vs Benefits Confusion

Product builders confound features with benefits—defining the dimension in terms of features to build rather than user-centric benefits.

**Why this happens:** We speak the language of features day in and day out.

**Consequence:** Fail to effectively validate in customer interviews. Customers don't speak the language of features—presenting a list of features elicits confusion because they can't intuit the benefits.

### Twitter Example

| User Benefit | Potential Features |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "Ensuring you always see the most relevant updates" | Algorithmic feed, lists, muting words |

Presenting "muting words" in customer interviews wouldn't reveal whether "seeing relevant updates" resonates.

### The Ideal Homepage Approach

Product homepages are intended to entice customers to try or buy—they should be the perfect distillation of differentiated value.

**Step 1: Define the Product Tagline**
- High-level value proposition
- Usually appears as first sentence in larger font
- Communicates overall value promise
- Succinctly summarizes product value

**Step 2: Define 3-5 Sub-Benefits**
- Specifically detail how the product solves key customer challenges
- Must be distinct from one another
- Move beyond high-level to specific value

**Note:** First draft may yield more than five benefits. Use validation techniques to streamline.

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Product tagline:** "Close more deals faster through social selling"

**Initial ten benefits (later narrowed to five through validation):**
- Proactively recommending potential leads at your accounts
- Replacing your spreadsheet with a better workflow for pre-opportunity account and lead management
- [8 additional benefits validated through customer research]

---

## 6. Competitive Advantage

### The Long-Term Blindspot

Product builders overlook long-term competitive advantage, focusing only on short-term.

**Definitions:**
- **Long-term competitive advantage:** How the product will establish a competitive and protective moat for lasting PMF advantage
- **Short-term competitive advantage:** How the product will win today in the current competitive landscape

> "The number one reason PMF is ephemeral is that product builders fail to build a competitive moat. We lose out because our product becomes commoditized by alternatives. At that point, we find ourselves fighting for relevance."
> — Sachin Rekhi

### The KISSMetrics Lesson

KISSMetrics offered unique analytics for online marketers: funnel reports, user-level tracking, live debugging. Customers loved it. They were three years ahead of competition.

**What happened:** Mixpanel quickly copied and caught up, then started innovating faster (deep mobile analytics support).

**Result:** Without long-term competitive advantage, KISSMetrics lost to a faster-moving competitor despite established short-term advantage.

### Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers

Seven common sources of successful long-term competitive advantage (focus on first four, most commonly leveraged):

| Power | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Scale Economics | Per-unit costs decline as production volume increases | Netflix streaming—upfront content costs spread across growing subscriber base |
| Network Economics | Value realized by customers increases as installed base increases | LinkedIn—more members = more valuable for each member |
| Counter-Positioning | New, superior business model discourages competitors from mimicking due to anticipated damage to existing business | Netflix vs Blockbuster—subscription vs per-rental |
| Switching Costs | Customers incur value loss from switching to alternate supplier | Enterprise software with deep integrations |
| Branding | | |
| Corner Resource | | |
| Process Power | | |

**Key insight:** A product can leverage multiple powers, especially as long-term advantage evolves.

### Netflix's Power Evolution

1. **Started with counter-positioning:** Subscription model letting customers keep and return videos at their own pace vs. Blockbuster's per-rental model
2. **Added scale economics:** Transitioned to streaming, paying upfront for content rights. Per-subscriber costs decrease as subscriber base grows. Challengers face higher per-subscriber costs with smaller bases.

### Short-Term Competitive Advantage Process

**Step 1: Identify Current Competitors**

| Category | Definition | Examples (LSN) |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Direct | Value propositions closest to ours | Hoovers, ZoomInfo, Lead411 |
| Indirect | Viable alternatives with different value prop | Industry conferences (organic warm introductions) |
| Adjacent Markets | Don't compete today but offer related services; could integrate or become future competitors | YesWare, Outreach, Salesforce (sales acceleration/CRM) |

**Step 2: Pinpoint Underserved Segments**

For each competitor, determine customer segments they best serve. Scan for segments underserved by competitors—these are where short-term competitive advantage will have high resonance.

> "What's important here is not what your competitive advantage is, but for whom you have that competitive advantage."
> — Sachin Rekhi

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Long-term advantage:** Network economics from core LinkedIn product prevented others from replicating the product idea.

**Short-term advantage:** Up-to-date accuracy and comprehensiveness of sales prospect profiles.

**Underserved segments with high resonance:** VPs and account executives managing >$100K deals—customer segments getting most value from comprehensive data enabling efficient prospect identification and rapport building. (Same segments prioritized as "Now" target audience.)

---

## 7. Growth Strategy

### The Channel Confusion

Product builders fail to realize that best channels for short-term traction will typically look quite different from long-term growth channels.

**Definitions:**

| Channel Type | Description | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Short-term traction | Non-scalable channels for initial traction goals (first 1000 B2C users or 10 B2B pilot customers) | Going to users offline, leveraging influencers for 1:1 messaging |
| Long-term growth | Scalable channels for large percentage of target audience | Viral loops, user-generated content loops, paid marketing loops, sales loops |

**Failure modes:**
- Focus too early on long-term channels → acquire users who don't retain
- Focus too long on short-term channels → rely on non-scalable, expensive tactics

> "The best practice for a long time was one growth strategy. Entrepreneurs have since come to realize that what works to get initial traction is different than what works to grow long term. This has led to the two-pronged approach."
> — Sachin Rekhi

### The Two-Pronged Process

**For short-term traction channels:**
1. Brainstorm channels to reach initial traction goal
2. Prioritize based on viability

**For long-term growth channels:**
1. Brainstorm channels for sustainable growth (different from short-term)
2. Prioritize based on viability

**Note for established orgs:** May focus only on long-term channels if already established. Zero-to-one startups need both, especially when long-term channels have long lead times.

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Established Org)

Skipped short-term because long-term channels were already established.

**To reach decision makers (VPs of Sales):**
- Leverage sales team to reach out via InMail (density of users already on platform)

**To reach end users (account executives):**
- Marketing team runs upsell campaigns to convert current customers using LinkedIn's free product

### Example: Slack (Zero-to-One)

Defined both channels because long-term involved long lead time.

**Short-term traction channel:**
- Founding team's own network

> "We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way."
> — Stewart Butterfield, Founder and CEO of Slack

**Long-term growth channel:**
- Sales team calling on and growing business with large enterprise customers

## 8. Business Model Equations

### The Surface-Level Trap

Product builders only consider business model at surface level (e.g., sources of revenue), overlooking pricing, cost structure, and lifetime value.

### The Business Equation

A set of levers to optimize profitability. Understanding the equation enables quick determination of high-impact actions when not profitable or growing as desired.

> "Every business, when it works, is like an equation—X times Y times Z with some weighting. Understanding that equation in your brain, and being able to manipulate the variables, is the key to being strategic."
> — Keith Rabois, General Partner at Founders Fund

### Four Key Lever Types

| Lever Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Revenue Streams | Sources of revenue (subscriptions, transactions, ads, take rate) |
| Pricing | Willingness to pay and payment model |
| Lifetime Value | Average revenue generated by customer over lifetime |
| Cost Structure | Sizable costs, both fixed and variable |

### Business Equations by Org Type

**Freemium SaaS** (Trello, Spotify, MailChimp):
- Free signups
- Monthly active users
- Free to paid conversion rate
- Average selling price
- Churn rates
- Customer acquisition cost
- Payback period

**Enterprise SaaS** (Slack, AWS, Salesforce):
- New opportunities
- Win rate (deals won / total opportunities)
- Average contract value
- Net revenue retention
- Sales expense ratio (sales expenses / net sales)

**Marketplace** (Airbnb, YouTube, Lyft):
- Gross merchandise volume
- Buyer liquidity (transactions / visits)
- Seller liquidity (listings with transactions / total listings)
- Take rate (% of GMV taken as revenue)
- Customer acquisition cost

**DTC E-commerce** (Everlane, Allbirds, Dollar Shave Club):
- Customer sessions
- Conversion rate
- Average order value
- Customer lifetime value
- Gross margin
- Customer acquisition cost

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Two business equations for two user roles:**

| Input | Decision Makers (VPs of Sales) | End Users (Account Executives) |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Revenue Streams | New opportunities, Win rate | Free trial starts, Free trial survival rate |
| Pricing | Average contract value | Average selling price |
| Lifetime Value | Net revenue retention | Renewal rate |
| Cost Structure | Sales expense ratio (sales team as fixed cost) | Marketing costs minimal (disregarded) |

---

## 9. Narrative Cohesion

### The Prose Forcing Function

A good PMF narrative document is thoughtfully articulated, compelling, and cohesive—dimensions work in concert with each other:
- Problem to solve resonates strongly with target audience
- Growth strategy complements business model
- Problem-solution fit exists

**The practice:** Write in prose versus bullets. Writing out hypotheses in successive sentences forces cause-and-effect thinking, unearthing logical inconsistencies across dimensions.

### Example: LinkedIn Sales Navigator Discovery

When converting their PMF narrative into prose, the team realized they had overlooked how short-term competitive advantage (comprehensive and real-time accurate sales lead data) connected with value proposition.

**Result:** Fine-tuned value proposition benefits to include data-related benefits like "deeply integrating your prospective workflow with CRM to avoid manual data entry."

### The Amazon Precedent

Jeff Bezos adopted written narratives through memos after frustration with bullet-point PowerPoints.

> "The narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's important and how things are related."
> — Jeff Bezos

## Action Items

### Before Building

- [ ] Pressure test initial insight: Is it earned, unique, and grounded in at least one PMF dimension?
- [ ] Apply outcome-motivation-gap approach to discover acute problems (not solution thinking)
- [ ] Define sequenced target audience: "Now" niche market before "Future" expansion
- [ ] Use ideal homepage approach for value proposition (benefits, not features)
- [ ] Identify both short-term (competitive landscape) and long-term (7 Powers) competitive advantage
- [ ] Define dual-channel growth strategy: traction channels + sustainable channels
- [ ] Build business equation with all four lever types

### During Definition

- [ ] For B2B/marketplace: Define dimensions for each user role (decision makers, end users)
- [ ] Ensure "Now" target audience has at least one of: most acute problem, strongest value prop resonance, strongest competitive advantage, greatest reach, strongest willingness to pay
- [ ] Map competitors across direct, indirect, and adjacent categories
- [ ] Identify underserved customer segments for short-term competitive advantage

### After First Draft

- [ ] Convert PMF narrative to prose to test cohesion
- [ ] Check for logical connections between dimensions
- [ ] Identify gaps in dimension connections and refine

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

1. **Validation techniques:** This module defines initial hypotheses but doesn't cover how to validate them (covered in subsequent modules)
2. **Initial insight generation:** The program focuses on growing insights, not brainstorming them
3. **Industry-specific considerations:** Examples focus heavily on B2B SaaS and marketplace models
4. **Resource constraints:** No discussion of how to adapt framework for different resource levels
5. **Iteration cycles:** Doesn't specify how often to update the PMF narrative or triggers for updates
