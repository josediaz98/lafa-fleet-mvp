# Growing Users: From Traction to Sustainable Growth

> Source: Reforge Product-Market Fit Program, Module 5
> Focus: Growth strategy development alongside product development

---

## Executive Summary

Growth strategy must be developed **alongside** the product—not bolted on after launch. The most common mistake is relying exclusively on linear tactics (press, outreach, ads) that require proportionally more resources to maintain. Sustainable growth requires transitioning from linear tactics to **growth loops**—self-reinforcing systems where acquiring one cohort of users automatically leads to the next.

The path to sustainable growth follows a deliberate sequence:
1. Use **linear tactics** to build initial traction (early users)
2. Transition to **growth loops** as the primary driver
3. Layer multiple loops to create a **growth engine**

The key insight: 80% of long-term growth for successful startups comes from just one or two growth loops. Focus beats diversification.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Two-Prong Growth Strategy

**The Problem with Linear Tactics**

Linear tactics are one-directional: resources in → users out. Examples:
- Press coverage
- Influencer endorsements
- Personal outreach
- Forum participation
- Flyers and street teams

**Why they fail long-term:**
- Output is proportional to input
- Exhausts most viable leads quickly
- Requires increasingly more effort for diminishing returns
- Never becomes self-sustaining

> "One of the most common mistakes among founders happens when I ask, 'How does your product grow?' The answer is typically a long list of linear tactics, because there's no hypothesis on what the growth engine is." — Brian Balfour, Reforge CEO

**The Solution: Growth Loops**

Growth loops are self-reinforcing systems with three steps:
1. **Input**: New user joins
2. **Action**: User takes steps within product
3. **Output**: Actions generate new users (reinvested as input)

**Three Categories of Growth Loops:**

| Category | Loop Types |
|----------|-----------|
| **Viral** | Word of mouth, Organic, Casual contact, Incentivized |
| **Content** | UGC-User distributed, UGC-Company distributed, CGC-User distributed, CGC-Company distributed |
| **Paid** | Advertising, Integration, Inbound sales, Outbound sales |

**The Evolution Pattern:**

Successful products follow a consistent trajectory:

| Company | Linear Tactics (Early) | Growth Loops (Later) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Atlassian | Developer meetups, branded swag | Freemium → organic viral → inbound sales |
| Uber | Street teams with coupons | Word of mouth → referral codes → Split Fare → Share ETA |
| Slack | CEO network outreach | Organic viral → inbound sales |
| Airbnb | Influencer relationships at events | Paid loops (hosts) + incentivized viral (guests) |

### 2. Traction Development Loop

Traction = initial demand that gets customers to start using the product.

**Critical Insight:** Develop traction **in parallel** with product development, not after.

> "I suppose our failure can be summed up quite easily: an inability to show traction. We should have released something far more lightweight, and as quickly as possible." — Jeremy Bell, Wattage Founder

**The Three-Step Loop:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│  1. DEFINE TRACTION GOAL               │
│     Based on product development phase  │
│                                         │

### 3. Traction Goals by Product Phase

| Phase | Focus | B2B Goal Example | B2C Goal Example |
|-------|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Pre-Product** | Recruit for validation techniques | 30-50 for PMF interviews; 100s for surveys | Same |
| **Post-Product** | Manageable set for deep feedback | 5 companies/month to trial | 100 users/month to trial |
| **Retention** | Enough users for statistical significance | 3 companies/week | 50 users/week |
| **Short-term Growth** | Critical mass while maintaining retention | 10 paying customers/month | 1,000 MAU |

**Additional Input:** Funding needs and investor expectations should inform traction goals, especially in later phases.

---

### 4. Five Traction Channels

#### Channel 1: Leveraging Personal Networks

**Reach:** Low to Medium (depends on overlap with target audience)

**Definition:** Using connections to solicit potential users

**Network Sources:**
- Family, friends, former colleagues
- Affiliation networks (alumni, etc.)
- Investors and their networks
- Incubator peers
- Second-degree connections (via warm intros)

**Best For:** Pre-product and post-product phases

**How to Assess:** Build a spreadsheet of contacts matching your "Now" customer segments. Export from LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and filter.

**Case Study: LinkedIn**
- Goal: Get hundreds of aspirational professionals on MVP
- Tactic: Invited 112 first/second-degree connections (VCs, executives)
- Result: High-quality early users providing detailed feedback

---

#### Channel 2: Tapping Into Existing Communities

**Reach:** Medium to High (depends on overlap with target audience)

**Definition:** Finding online/offline communities where target audience congregates

**Online Community Types:**

| Type | Examples | How to Use |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Community platforms | Facebook Groups, Reddit, Discord | Search keywords for target audience |
| New product communities | Product Hunt, Betalist, AppSumo | Submit product for exposure/feedback |
| Q&A communities | Quora, Stack Overflow | Find people with your "problem to solve" |
| Specialized communities | Hacker News, Indie Hackers, Nextdoor | Discover niche interest groups |
| Social media | Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram | Use hashtags, find community leaders |

**Offline Communities:** Conferences, trade shows, local meetups, campus events

**Best For:** All phases (medium reach → early phases; high reach → later phases)

**Case Study: Farmstead**
- Goal: Survey hundreds of potential customers for validation
- Tactic: Posted on Nextdoor (high overlap with busy parents)
- Result: 200 interested users in 2 days; became early customers

**Case Study: DoorDash**
- Tactic: Flyers all over Stanford campus
- Result: Built critical mass in one region

---

#### Channel 3: Building an Audience

**Reach:** High (contingent on compelling content + right platform)

**Definition:** Releasing content on online platforms in parallel with product development

**Content Formats:** Long-form text, short-form text, images, short/long video, audio, presentations, live video

**Platforms:** Newsletters, LinkedIn, Twitter, Substack, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts

**Best For:** Post-product through short-term growth phases

**Considerations:**
- Requires deliberate content strategy
- Only leverage if team has content marketing expertise
- Can scale over time

**Case Study: Drift**
- Goal: Find first companies to trial B2B conversational marketing product
- Tactic: Published in-depth product marketing guide (no product mentions) 6 months before launch
- Process: Tested platforms by reaching out to 15 product marketers on each; evolved to newsletter format
- Result: Built credibility and sourced initial users from newsletter audience

---

#### Channel 4: Getting Press

**Reach:** High

**Definition:** Reaching out to media outlets to solicit product coverage

**Publication Types:**
- Niche/industry-specific publications (often more effective)
- Major tech outlets (TechCrunch, etc.)
- Mainstream media (WSJ, NYT, CNN)

**Best For:** Retention and short-term growth phases; sometimes post-product. **Avoid in pre-product phase.**

**Newsworthy Events:**
- New funding round
- Traction milestones (100K users, $1M revenue)
- Signing prominent customers
- New product/feature launches

**Case Study: Mint**
- Goal: Thousands of signups at launch
- Approach: Started with niche finance bloggers → specialty publications (GetRichSlowly) → tech publications (Mashable, Lifehacker) → major outlets (CNN, WSJ)
- Key Success Factor: Human interest angle in pitch, not just product features

**Tool:** Use SimilarWeb to estimate and compare publication reach

---

#### Channel 5: Targeting Influencers

**Reach:** Medium to High

**Definition:** Building relationships with impactful promoters who share product with their audience

**Influencer Tiers:**

| Tier | Followers | Engagement |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Nano | 1K-10K | Highest |
| Micro | 10K-100K | High |
| Macro | 100K-1M | Medium |
| Mega | 1M+ | Lower |

**Key Insight:** Nano and micro influencers have highest engagement rates. Don't only pursue mega influencers.

**Evaluation Factors:** Follower count, engagement (likes/comments/shares per post), brand fit, cost

**Best For:** Retention and short-term growth phases. **Avoid in pre-product phase.**

**Common Spaces:** DTC e-commerce, B2B sales

**Case Study: Patreon**
- Goal: Grow critical mass of creators
- Tactic: Leveraged existing creators as nano/micro influencers
- Approach: Creators naturally promoted their Patreon pages; non-Patreon creators saw revenue transparency
- Expansion: Partnered outreach team with influential creators (e.g., Zach Weinersmith) to open new creator genres

### 5. Channel Reach Summary

| Channel | Reach | Best Phases | Key Consideration |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Personal Networks | Low-Medium | Pre-product, Post-product | Overlap with target audience |
| Existing Communities | Medium-High | All phases | Online vs. offline fit |
| Building Audience | High | Post-product → Growth | Requires content expertise |
| Getting Press | High | Retention, Growth | Need newsworthy events |
| Targeting Influencers | Medium-High | Retention, Growth | Engagement > follower count |

**Decision Framework:** When choosing between channels, consider which has more significant overlap with your target audience.

---

### 6. Testing Traction Channels

**Principle:** Don't split effort across many channels. Test to identify 1-2 winners.

| Channel | Testing Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Personal Networks** | Reach out to ~10 randomized contacts (mix of 1st/2nd degree); measure response rate; extrapolate |
| **Communities** | Pick top community; comment first, then post about product; measure interest/response rate |
| **Building Audience** | Publish 5-10 pieces over 1-4 weeks; review engagement rates; iterate on format/platform |
| **Press** | Difficult to test; evaluate success after a PR campaign to decide on future investment |
| **Influencers** | Test one influencer at a time; measure signups from collaboration; assess cost-effectiveness |

---

### 7. Growth Loop Selection Framework

**Critical Insight:** Establishing one growth loop requires enormous activation energy (money, time, focus). Don't divide effort.

> "Our intuition is that we can test a bunch of growth loops and then figure out which ones are working. But no one ever gets to the 'rule out and focus' stage because it takes so much work to get any channel to work." — Sachin Rekhi

**Example: What It Takes to Build an Organic Viral Loop**
1. Enable invites during onboarding
2. Enable invites post-onboarding (active users)
3. Send invite reminder emails
4. Enable content sharing with non-users
5. Provide compelling activity summaries for non-users

Shallow execution (1 of 5) = ineffective loop.

---

### 8. Model Channel Fit (ARPU/CAC Spectrum)

**Principle:** Business model enables or disables certain growth loops.

```
LOW ARPU ←────────────────────────────────────────→ HIGH ARPU
LOW CAC                                              HIGH CAC

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│  Non-incentivized    UGC      CGC    Ads    Inbound   Outbound
│  viral loops         loops   loops  loops   sales     sales
│                                                             │
│  Facebook            Airbnb   NYT    Headspace  Hubspot  Palantir
│  Yelp                Dropbox  Lonely  Warby     Slack    Marketo
│  YouTube             Robinhood Planet  Parker            Salesforce
│                                       SurveyMonkey
│                                                             │
│  $12 ARPU           $10s    $10s    $100s     $1000s   $100K+
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Detailed ARPU/CAC Mapping:**

| ARPU | Growth Loops | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Free (ad-monetized) | Non-incentivized viral, UGC-UD, UGC-CD | Facebook, Yelp, YouTube |
| Low ($10s) | Incentivized viral | Airbnb, Dropbox, Robinhood |
| Low-Medium ($10s) | CGC loops | NYT, Lonely Planet |
| Medium ($100s) | Integration loops | Zapier, Stripe |
| Medium ($100s) | Ad loops | Headspace, Warby Parker, SurveyMonkey |
| High ($1000s) | Inbound sales | Hubspot, Slack |
| Very High ($100K+) | Outbound sales | Palantir, Marketo, Salesforce |

**Marketplace Note:** May need two loops (one per side). Airbnb: incentivized viral (guests) + paid (hosts).

**Inbound Sales Note:** Requires a second loop to generate leads (e.g., HubSpot uses CGC; Slack uses organic viral).

**Common Pitfall:** Thinking outbound sales is needed when ARPU actually warrants inbound sales.

### 9. Exceptions: When to Push Higher CAC

**Scenario 1: Driving Network Effects**

When building both sides of a marketplace, higher CAC may be justified to establish network effects.

*Example: Postmates* used paid loops despite low initial ARPU to build restaurant and user base simultaneously.

**Scenario 2: Market Dynamics**

In winner-takes-all competitive landscapes with sufficient funding, speed > efficiency.

*Examples: Instacart, ShopPay*

> "In the short term, we might decide to drive unprofitable growth. That's ok as long as it's a deliberate strategy that ultimately bridges you to PMF. Our long-term goal, though, should still be to get to a sustainable ARPU to CAC ratio." — Sachin Rekhi

---

### 10. Product Channel Fit

**Principle:** Products must be built to fit growth loops. Loops are fixed; products adapt.

**Evaluation Questions by Loop Type:**

| Loop | Key Question |
|------|-------------|
| **Organic Viral** | Can our product experience improve for a user if they bring on others? |
| **CGC** | Do we have team capability to generate high-quality content at cost below value generated? |
| **Ad Loop** | Can product be easily described in an ad? Can we efficiently target segments? Can we generate revenue fast enough for reasonable payback? |
| **UGC** | Do users have motivation to create content that can be shared with others? |
| **Incentivized Viral** | Are we making enough money per user to offer monetary rewards for referrals? |
| **Word of Mouth** | Can our product create raving fans who naturally talk about their experience? |
| **Casual Contact** | Is there a way our product can naturally expose non-users to it? |

---

### 11. Synthesizing Model + Product Channel Fit

**Outcome 1: Fits Converge**

When both fits point to the same 1-2 loops → double down and execute deeply.

**Case Study: Connected (Alternative Scenario)**
- ARPU: $120/year (too low for Google ads)
- Model Channel Fit → Viral or Content loops
- Product Channel Fit evaluation:
  - Incentivized viral: ❌ (limited first-month revenue, easy cancellation)
  - Word of mouth: ❌ (paid product, niche audience unlikely to know others in segment)
  - Casual contact: ❌ (users didn't want "Sent by Connected" footers)
  - Organic viral: ✅ (users wanted sharing for warm intros)
  - UGC: ❌ (no shareable user content)
  - CGC: ✅ (validation showed interest in contact management content; team had marketing capability)
- **Result:** Pursue organic viral + CGC-company distributed

**Outcome 2: Fits Diverge (The Danger Zone)**

The danger zone sits between CGC and paid on the ARPU/CAC spectrum:
- ARPU too high for low-CAC loops (price creates friction)
- ARPU too low for high-CAC loops (economics don't work)

**Solution:** Pivot product strategy dimensions to align with a viable loop:
- Move up-market (increase price point)
- Enhance value prop to justify premium
- Refine target audience to niche willing to pay more
- Return to validation step to prove new hypothesis

## Critical Gaps & Limitations

1. **Loop optimization not covered** — Program focuses on selecting first loop, not optimizing or layering. Recommended: Reforge Growth Series for advanced content.

2. **B2B nuances underexplored** — Multi-stakeholder buying processes and enterprise sales cycles get limited treatment.

3. **International expansion not addressed** — Growth loops may behave differently across markets.

4. **Loop failure scenarios** — Limited guidance on when to abandon a loop vs. keep optimizing.

5. **Metrics thresholds missing** — "Response rate" and "engagement" mentioned without specific benchmarks.

## Quick Reference: Decision Trees

### Choosing a Traction Channel

```
Is your network >50% overlap with target audience?
├─ YES → Start with Personal Networks
└─ NO → Are there active communities for your audience?
         ├─ YES → Start with Existing Communities
         └─ NO → Do you have content marketing expertise?
                  ├─ YES → Build an Audience
                  └─ NO → Wait for newsworthy event → Get Press
```

### Choosing a Growth Loop

```
What is your ARPU?
├─ Free/Ad-supported → Non-incentivized viral or UGC loops
├─ $10-50 → Incentivized viral loops
├─ $50-200 → CGC or Integration loops
├─ $200-500 → Ad loops
├─ $500-5000 → Inbound sales (need lead gen loop)
└─ $5000+ → Outbound sales
```
