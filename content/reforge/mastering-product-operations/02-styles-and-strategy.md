# Product Operations: Styles & Strategy

## Executive Summary

Defining your Product Ops style adds structure to how work gets done and ensures accountability. Then, building a strategy connects your challenges, strengths, and operating model into a cohesive plan.

## Part 1: The Four Style Dimensions

### 1. Work Allocation

| Shared Service | Embedded |
|----------------|----------|
| Pooled resource for entire department | Assigned to specific teams |
| Systemic, cross-team issues | Team-specific challenges |
| Fewer people, more teams | Tight PM alignment needed |

**Use Shared Service when:** More teams than ops people, emphasizing consistency, improving cross-department collaboration.

**Use Embedded when:** Complex organizations with overworked teams, tight strategy alignment needed, improving within-team collaboration.

**Hybrid example (DoorDash):** Directors own ops in their area (embedded), collaborate for company-wide consistency (shared service).

---

### 2. Degree of Focus

| Specialists | Generalists |
|-------------|-------------|
| Deep expertise in one area | Flexible across all ops areas |
| Larger teams, specific goals | Smaller teams, swarming problems |
| Dedicated product ops hires | PMs leading ops work |

**Common mistake:** Choosing generalists without staffing accordingly.

---

### 3. Operating Principle

| Enabling | Coaching | Execution |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Create infrastructure & tools | Teach processes | Do work for others |
| Reduce friction | Standardize "the company way" | Free up PM time |
| Most common model | Junior/SME PMs | Risk: blurs into BA role |

**Examples:**
- **Enabling (Nylas):** Built roadmap reporting tools; PMs do the reporting
- **Coaching (Kroger):** Training team teaches product practices
- **Execution (Uber):** Ops team handles user feedback synthesis and rollout coordination

---

### 4. Team Hierarchy

| Integrated with PM Leadership | Separate Team |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| PMs feel the pain, motivated to fix | Deep focus on ops challenges |
| Small teams, can't afford separate role | Explicit resource allocation |

**Reporting options:**
- **To CPO:** Turnaround situations, product development focus
- **To COO/Other:** Complex cross-department needs, strong ops culture to leverage

---

## Part 2: Building the Strategy

### Step 1: Pick Priorities

1. Find critical challenges from research
2. Map causation (which problems cause others)
3. Highlight most connected nodes (fix one, fix many)
4. Narrow to realistic near-term scope
5. Stack-rank

**Tip:** Look for feedback loops (communication issues → execution problems → more communication breakdown).

**Common mistake:** Being too broad. "Stakeholder communications issues" is too vague. "Stakeholders unsure what's on roadmap" is actionable.

---

### Step 2: Identify Strengths to Leverage

- Don't just focus on what's broken
- Find where a strength can combat a challenge
- Look for adjacencies (expand existing strength to new area)

**Example (GitHub):** Uses internal dogfooding culture to get ops tooling prioritized on the product roadmap.

---

### Step 3: Align Style to Priorities

Cross-reference your style choices against challenges:

| Misalignment Example | Problem |
|---------------------|---------|
| Weak onboarding → independent ops team | Hard to fix without PM leadership integration |
| Data quality issues → generalists | Need data specialist |
| 5 priorities, 1 person | Too many priorities or too little time |

**Common mistakes:**
- Understaffing for the challenges
- Skills mismatch for the domain
- Adding work without removing other responsibilities

---

### Step 4: Make Sense of the Pieces

1. Hypothesize infrastructure needed (tools, training, systems, processes, people)
2. Combine: challenges + strengths + people + infrastructure → vision

**Tip:** Tell a story, not bullet points. "Once upon a time, there was a company that wanted [vision]. But they couldn't get there because [challenges]. So they decided to [leverage strengths] using [operating style] to [implement infrastructure]."

**Common mistake:** Getting too prescriptive. Strategy shows the path, not every step.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Don't figure it out alone** — work with partners across the company
2. **Don't expect the first draft to be final** — iterate like a product
3. **Consider hybrid models** — specialists for some pillars, leadership for others
4. **Staff correctly for your style** — different styles need different ratios
5. **There is no universal optimal** — only optimal for your company

## Quick Reference: Decision Matrix

| Decision | Choose A when... | Choose B when... |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Shared vs Embedded | Few ops people, many teams | Need tight PM alignment |
| Specialist vs Generalist | Large team, specific goals | Small team, flexibility needed |
| Enabling vs Coaching | Want broad impact, fewer people | Junior PMs, need standardization |
| Enabling vs Execution | Prioritizing systemic fixes | Overworked teams, no appetite for systemic change |
| Integrated vs Separate | Small team, want motivated fixers | Need explicit ops investment |
