# Feedback - Interview with Levi Garcia

**Interview date:** February 6, 2026
**Overall rating:** 7.5/10 - Good, with clear areas for improvement

## What you did well

### 1. Prior research — your best moment
Before talking about yourself, you demonstrated that you'd researched LAFA thoroughly. You mentioned JJ's founder-market fit (One Capital, Megametrics, China), the driver economics (40-50% on gasoline), and the CDMX regulation. Levi validated every point and even added new data (the $300 vs $1,200-$1,500). This positioned you as someone who understands the business, not just the technology.

### 2. The NUMA demo was a differentiator
You didn't just talk about AI — you showed something working. Onboarding, professional portal, patient portal, ChatGPT API integration. Levi was so engaged that he himself suggested a feature (bilingual summary for his wife). When an interviewer starts co-creating with you, that's a very positive signal.

### 3. The Yape project landed with numbers
300K conversations/month, 1,000 typologies reduced to 450, 12% error vs 30% human. You gave concrete metrics, not just narrative. And Levi connected immediately because his wife built something similar at Stori — you created an "aha moment" of relevance.

### 4. The personal connection was natural
Padel, swimming, even the suggestion to "have a match sometime" — the conversation flowed. It didn't sound forced. For a startup with 150 cars where you'd be working side-by-side with Levi, cultural fit matters a lot.

## What you could have done better

### 1. Your pitch was too long and chronological
From Pacifico to Singularity University, FAVO, JOKR, InRetail, Yape... you gave him a complete biography. The risk: Levi had to wait too long to get to what he cared about (AI). Note that his reaction after your entire career story was:

> *"Quite interesting, but entirely a Product Management story... But yeah, let's keep going."*

That "but yeah, let's keep going" is a signal that he was waiting for the AI part. He'd already told you exactly what he wanted to hear: *"what's your experience with AI platforms."*

**Improvement for JJ:** Invert the order. Lead with NUMA + the Yape project (AI), then use your career path as supporting context, not as the introduction.

### 2. You didn't explicitly connect your experience to LAFA's problems
Levi told you exactly what they need: internal tools, operational efficiency, eliminate spreadsheets, team of 3 people. Your InRetail experience (rebuilding from scratch, internal tools, data lake migration) is DIRECTLY relevant, and you didn't make that connection explicit. You left it implicit.

**Improvement for JJ:** Build the bridge: *"What I did at InRetail — rebuilding tech from scratch with a small team — is exactly what LAFA needs. Except now I have AI as a force multiplier."*

### 3. You were missing strategic questions for Levi
You didn't ask him questions about the business, operational challenges, or the product vision. The questions you ask reveal how you think. Asking things like "What's the most painful process you manage in spreadsheets today?" or "What decisions can't you make today because of missing data?" would have shown applied product thinking.

### 4. NUMA: you conceded the weakness against Doctoralia
When Levi mentioned Doctoralia, your response was *"Right, NUMA hadn't gotten that far yet."* That sounded a bit defeatist. It would have been better to reframe: *"Doctoralia solves the marketplace; I'm solving the intelligence layer within the session — the transcription, the summary, the sentiment. They're complementary layers."*

### 5. The technical stack came across as superficial
You mentioned Replit, GitHub, Claude Code, ChatGPT API, Zendesk, Databricks, BigQuery. But you didn't go deeper on architecture decisions. For a role where you'd be the sole AI builder, Levi (and especially JJ) will want to know you can make solid technical decisions, not just use tools.

## Signals from Levi (reading between the lines)

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|
| *"Product Management with a lot of strategy, I'm impressed"* | Positive but with nuance: what impressed him is the strategy, not necessarily the technical profile |
| *"And with your backend and database knowledge, quite good"* | He's giving you credit for something that's not your core — a signal he's trying to figure out how you fit |
| *"But yeah, let's keep going"* | He wanted to get to the AI part; your career story seemed good but not sufficient on its own |
| He suggests a feature for NUMA (bilingual summary) | Strong signal: he's co-creating with you, he sees you as a builder |
| *"I just arrived at that exact same point — awesome"* (about the Replit->GitHub->Claude workflow) | Genuine connection: he's also learning, he sees you as a peer |
| Mentions his wife built a ticket classifier | He's validating you: "I know this problem firsthand" |
| *"Since you'd be working with me"* | He's evaluating you as a direct collaborator, not just as a candidate |

## Recommendations for the JJ interview

1. **Open with impact:** NUMA demo + Yape project in the first 5 minutes. Your career story is the backup, not the main event.
2. **Connect the dots:** "At InRetail I rebuilt everything from spreadsheets with a small team. At Yape I shipped AI to production with 300K conversations/month. LAFA needs both of those things."
3. **Bring business questions:** JJ is the founder and manages the relationship with China. Ask him about unit economics, the 50% tariff risk, and the ecosystem vision (charging centers, maintenance).
4. **Show that you think in 0-to-1:** Bring a mini-proposal of what you'd build first (operational dashboard > database > shift dispatch). That demonstrates prioritization judgment, which is exactly what they need.
5. **Don't be modest about NUMA:** Reframe Doctoralia as complementary, not as a superior competitor. Your differentiator is the in-session AI.
