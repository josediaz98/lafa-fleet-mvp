## Job Description

**AI Product Engineer (Internal Tools)**
Location: LATAM (Remote / Hybrid)

**Why this position?** LAFA is looking to transform operational efficiency through AI-powered internal tools. Not a ticket-taker -- a technical product enthusiast who can identify bottlenecks and build scalable solutions.

**The Profile: "The Builder"** -- someone who moves comfortably between product discovery and technical deployment. If you have launched an MVP on your own, failed, iterated, and finally watched someone use your tool -- you are exactly who they need.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Identify Opportunities: Engage with internal stakeholders to understand where the process "hurts" and propose solutions based on AI/LLMs or tools that offer a superior alternative to existing ones.
- End-to-End Construction: Design, develop, and deploy internal tools (from simple interfaces to backend logic and prompt orchestration).
- Self-Management: Work based on deliverables and OKRs. Execute without needing anyone to hold your hand.
- Technical Evangelization: Teach the rest of the team how to leverage these tools to boost company-wide productivity.

**Technical Requirements & Skills:**
- Entrepreneurial Mindset: Built your own projects (side projects, startups, or Open Source tools).
- Hybrid Profile: Think like a PM (prioritization, metrics, UX) but execute like an Engineer (API design, Python/Node, integrations).
- Proven AI Experience: Projects implementing LLMs (OpenAI API, LangChain, CrewAI, Replit, Lovable, or V0). Just using ChatGPT doesn't count.
- Chronic Self-Learner: The AI ecosystem changes every week; learn and discard technologies at record speed.
- Advanced English: Document, read technical papers, communicate with global teams.

**Bonus Points:**
- Previous experience as a Product Manager or Technical Engineer.
- Solid knowledge of Backend architecture and databases.
- A GitHub portfolio or a live demo of a tool built from scratch.
