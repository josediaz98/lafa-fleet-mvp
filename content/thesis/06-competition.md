# 06 — Competition and Moats

> *Detailed competitor data: [analysis/market/competitive-landscape.md](../analysis/market/competitive-landscape.md) | Vemo deep-dive: [vemo-benchmark/](../vemo-benchmark/)*

**VC Question:** "Who else is solving this? Why will LAFA win?"

---

## Verdict: LAFA Has Real Differentiation But a Massive Capital Disadvantage

LAFA competes against companies with 30-100x more capital. Its differentiation — 100% EV + direct access to Chinese OEMs + depot charging — is real but is not a moat yet. The only defensible long-term moat is **control of charging infrastructure**, and that requires capital LAFA does not yet have.

## Competitive Landscape in Mexico

### VEMO — $500M+, 2,000+ EVs, 18 states

The direct benchmark — Levi names it explicitly (Feb 2026). Funding 100x+ greater than LAFA; ZEE platform (battery ML, charging optimization) is the tech blueprint. Planned CAPEX: $1.5B -> 55,000 EVs + 23,000 connectors. **vs LAFA:** same thesis (DaE + LTO + 100% EV) but at massive scale; weakness in dependence on OEMs under tariff pressure.

### OCN (OneCarNow) — $100M+, 5,000+ vehicles, 22 states

AI underwriting in <90 min with single-digit defaults for 2+ years (gold standard). 25K+ active customers, profitable since month 3. CTO: Ammar Naqvi (ex-Amazon, Careem). **vs LAFA:** majority ICE (~12-15% EV) and no charging infra — LAFA differentiates with 100% EV + depot charging. But OCN has 10-50x more capital.

### BYD Fleet Operations — Dominant EV seller (~40K units 2024)

Taxi program in Nuevo Leon (Nov 2025) with lease included. **Threat:** vertical integration OEM->fleet can disintermediate LAFA. **Mitigant:** 50% tariff raises their cost; Mexico factory not yet operational.

### DiDi Fleet Programs — Target 100K EVs in Mexico by 2030

Currently a **channel/partner** for LAFA (not a competitor). Investment: ~$55M USD. Future risk: verticalization of fleet ops.

## LatAm Benchmarks

There are 7+ comparable operators in LatAm (VEMO, OCN, Moove/Kovi, Leasy, Planet42, Muverang, Splend). Key trend: consolidation (Moove acquired Kovi, Jan 2025 — combined $275M ARR, 36K vehicles). Standalone players without sufficient capital face a growth ceiling.

## Differentiation Matrix

| Dimension | LAFA | VEMO | OCN |
|-----------|------|------|-----|
| **Fleet type** | 100% EV | 100% EV | Mostly ICE (~12-15% EV) |
| **Products** | DaE + LTO (dual) | Conduce + Impulso + Flotas | Subscription only |
| **Charging** | Depot (planned expansion) | 1,200+ public connectors | None |
| **Tech maturity** | Spreadsheets (Stage 0) | ZEE platform (ML) | Full in-house AI platform |
| **Capital** | Undisclosed (likely <$10M) | $500M+ | $100M+ |
| **Fleet size** | ~150 | 2,000+ | 5,000+ |
| **Chinese OEM access** | Direct (JJ works with China) | Through distributors | N/A (mostly ICE OEMs) |
| **Credit scoring** | Manual/none | Unknown | AI underwriting (<90 min) |
| **Geography** | CDMX only | 18 states + planned | 22 states + US |

## Competitive Moat Assessment

**LAFA's current moat: WEAK.** At 150 vehicles with spreadsheets, there is no moat. Any well-capitalized competitor can replicate the operation.

**Potential moat (if executed):**

| Moat | Timeline | Defensibility | Dependency |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Depot charging -> Public charging network** | 12-24 months | HIGH — real switching costs for drivers | Capital + CFE + locations |
| **Data advantage** (payment history, telematics, driver behavior) | 6-12 months | MEDIUM — proprietary but replicable | Tech build (Track A foundation+) |
| **Direct Chinese OEM relationships** (JJ) | Already exists | MEDIUM — depends on one person | JJ permanence |
| **DaE->LTO graduation flywheel** | 6-12 months | MEDIUM-HIGH — internal DaE data is a warm-start for LTO scoring | Execution |
| **JAC local assembly cost advantage** | Already exists | LOW — not exclusive; others can buy JAC | Market access |

**What LAFA can learn from each competitor:**
- **From VEMO:** Vertical integration works. ZEE platform is the blueprint (80/20 version). But $500M+ is not necessary to start — it is to scale.
- **From OCN:** AI underwriting is the gold standard. Single-digit defaults for 2+ years. Warm-start with internal data can close this gap.
- **From Kovi/Moove:** Scale matters — standalone players in single markets face a capital ceiling. Premature expansion destroys value (Splend failed in Mexico).
- **From BYD:** Vertical integration from OEM to fleet is the ultimate threat. JAC local assembly is the defense.

## Threats

| Threat | Severity | Timeline | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| VEMO scaling to 55K vehicles | HIGH | 3-5 years | Differentiate on service quality, driver experience, niche |
| OCN expanding EV fleet | MEDIUM | 1-2 years | Build a charging moat that OCN lacks |
| BYD national fleet model | MEDIUM-HIGH | 1-3 years | 50% tariff raises BYD's cost; local JAC assembly is cheaper |
| Uber/DiDi verticalizing fleet ops | MEDIUM | 2-5 years | Deep partnerships (already a DiDi ally) |
| Tariff changes favoring imports | LOW | Uncertain | Diversify OEM mix; JAC local assembly is the hedge |
| New entrants (FAZT, SEV) | LOW | Ongoing | First-mover in DaE + LTO combo |
