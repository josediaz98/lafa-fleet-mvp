# 07 — Team

**VC Question:** "Can this team build a $100M company? Where are the gaps?"

---

## Verdict: Launch Team, Not Scale Team

LAFA has a **core of 5 people assembled in the last 6 months** around CEO JJ. The team is optimized for **commercial launch and operational hustle** — but completely lacks technical talent, engineering, or data science. The AI Product Engineer hire would be the first technical person in the company, entering an organization with zero tech infrastructure and a 13x growth target in 12 months.

**Founder-market fit:** STRONG on credentials (JJ: Capital One credit risk + Stori fintech + EV leasing convergence), but with execution risk due to remote CEO and team without proven cohesion.

## Recruiting Networks

### Stori Pipeline
JJ and Levi know each other from **Stori Card** (Mexican unicorn, $250M+ raised). Levi confirmed: "it was founded by a friend of mine from Stori." Marsha lists Stori as a concurrent role. **3 of 5 members have a Stori connection** — strong trust network but also recruiting bias.

### Mi Nave Pipeline
Daniel Briones and Diego Gonzales arrived together from **Mi Nave** (competitor in vehicle leasing for the gig economy). Both left in the same period and joined LAFA in Sep 2025. This implies:
- Direct knowledge of the competitor's business model
- Potential access to GTM and conversion playbooks
- Daniel likely brought Diego as part of his team

### Connection Map

```
STORI ──────────> JJ (CEO)
  |                 |
  |              founded LAFA
  |                 |
  +──────────> Levi (Head of Product) ── "Stori friend"
  |
  +──────────> Marsha (Ops Director) ── "Oct 2021-Present" at Stori

MI NAVE ────────> Daniel (Sales & CX Dir.) ── Commercial Dir. at Mi Nave
  |                 |
  +──────────> Diego (Sales Supervisor) ── likely recruited by Daniel
```

## Why They CAN Execute

1. **Strong quantitative and fintech credentials in leadership.** JJ brings $30M NPV incremental in risk models (Capital One) and 2x bookings growth (Stori). Levi delivered $100K USD/month in routing savings and $2M USD in revenue from DCC at Clip.

2. **Direct competitor knowledge.** Daniel and Diego come from Mi Nave (virtually identical model). They bring pricing, conversion, churn, and operations intel from a direct competitor.

3. **Proven commercial execution in LatAm.** Daniel scaled Destacame from 27K to 3M users and grew revenue 31x. At Mi Nave he improved lead-to-car conversion 67% and reduced CAC 27%.

4. **Cross-functional operational capacity.** Marsha brings international sourcing (China), ERP implementation, organizational restructuring — directly relevant for a company importing Chinese vehicles.

5. **Pre-existing trust network.** JJ-Levi (Stori), Daniel-Diego (Mi Nave), Marsha-JJ/Levi (Stori). Reduces coordination friction at early stage.

## Key Team Risks

### 1. ZERO technical/engineering talent
**The most critical gap.** None of the 5 have a software technical profile. JJ has a data science background but is CEO. There is no engineer, data engineer, DBA, or DevOps. All technology must be built from scratch with the first technical hire.

### 2. No CTO or VP Engineering
3 technical people would report to Levi (PM, not a technical leader). The AI Product Engineer would be the de facto tech lead without the title or the team. Architecture decisions (PostgreSQL vs alternatives, AWS region, API design, data model) would be made by a single person without peer review.

### 3. Zero AI/ML depth
Despite the "AI Orchestrator" branding (Levi) and "AI-driven backend" (website), there is no real AI/ML capability. JJ has ML in his Capital One/Stori background but no longer operates as an IC. The AI Product Engineer would not only build AI — they would be the only person who understands AI.

### 4. Part-time dedication from the Head of Product
Levi is part-time (Nov 2025-Present). The AI Product Engineer would report to someone not full-time. During Track A foundation build-out, part-time oversight is a significant operational risk.

### 5. Concentration in closed networks
All recruiting comes from 2 networks (Stori + Mi Nave). Echo chamber risk, limited talent surface area, key-person dependency.

### 6. Short tenures and non-cohesive team

| Person | Previous tenure | Time at LAFA |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| JJ | Stori ~2.5 years | ~15 months |
| Levi | Clip 2.4 years | ~4 months (part-time) |
| Daniel | Mi Nave 1.3 years | ~5 months |
| Marsha | AME 5 years | ~13 months |
| Diego | Mi Nave 1.1 years | ~5 months |

The team has not gone through any crisis, pivot, or complete operational cycle together.

## Risk: Team x Roadmap

| Roadmap Project | Who executes | Who oversees | Key team risk |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| P0.1 Database | Jose (sole) | Levi (part-time) | Zero redundancy. Architecture without peer review. |
| P0.2 Dashboard | Jose | Levi | Low — Metabase is low risk |
| P0.3 Maintenance | Jose | Marsha (ops) | Marsha can define requirements; Jose executes alone |
| P0.4 Shift dispatch | Jose | Daniel/Diego (sales) | Functional — commercial team knows what it needs |
| P1 Onboarding AI | Jose | Levi | GPT-4o Vision decisions without ML validation |
| P2 Credit Scoring | Jose | Levi + JJ (risk bg) | **JJ can contribute here** — Capital One/Stori experience |
| P3 Collections Bot | Jose | Daniel (collections) | Daniel understands operational collections — good stakeholder |
| P4 Battery Monitoring | Jose | Nobody | **Highest risk.** Nobody understands telematics, IoT, or battery science |
| P5 Charging Ops | Jose | Marsha (ops) | Marsha understands operations; technical optimization is Jose's |
| P7 Dashboard Enhanced | Jose + (hire #2?) | Levi | If hire #2 arrives by Mo 6, they can contribute |
| P8 Knowledge Bot | Jose | Levi | Low technical risk (RAG is well-understood) |

**Conclusion:** The highest-risk projects due to team gaps are P0.1 (foundation without review), P4 (battery monitoring without expertise), and P2 (credit scoring — mitigable if JJ participates actively). The complementary technical hire is needed by Mo 4-6 at the latest.

## Implications for Jose

### The positive
1. **Disproportionate impact guaranteed.** Every line of code has direct impact on operations.
2. **Direct access to leadership.** 2 levels from the CEO in a 5-person company.
3. **CV differentiator.** "First technical hire who scaled EV mobility startup from 150 to X vehicles."
4. **Complementary commercial team.** Jose doesn't need to sell or operate — he can focus 100% on product and tech.

### The concerning
1. **Total technical isolation.** No peer review, pair programming, or mentor.
2. **Part-time supervisor.** Levi is not full-time — risk of operating as an autonomous IC disguised as a team.
3. **Possible misaligned expectations.** Commercial/ops team may underestimate the complexity of building tech from scratch.
4. **Risk of "do-everything-ism."** DBA + backend + frontend + data engineer + ML engineer + DevOps. At 150 vehicles it's manageable; at 2,000 it's unsustainable without more hires.
5. **Team retention risk.** Short tenures and a newly formed team.

### Critical questions for JJ
- Technical hiring plan in the first 6 months? (3 people planned — when and with what profile?)
- Will Levi go full-time? When?
- Budget for cloud infrastructure/tooling?
- How does JJ make technical decisions while remote?
- Current runway and funding plan?
