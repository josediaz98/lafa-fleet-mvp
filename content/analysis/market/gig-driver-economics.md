**Last updated:** February 7, 2026
**Scope:** Mexico's gig driver market size, EV vs ICE economics for ride-hailing drivers, regulatory incentives that make EVs attractive to drivers, and what it means for LAFA's two products.

## 1. Market Size

Mexico's gig economy is one of the largest in Latin America:

- ~658,000 platform workers registered under the 2025 labor reform
- DiDi: 350,000+ drivers and delivery workers
- Uber: 250,000-300,000+ active partners
- Full-time DiDi car driver in CDMX grosses ~MXN $18,000-25,000/month (driver payout after platform commission, before fuel and vehicle costs; per Indeed CDMX data and IMSS 2026 threshold of $25,773 for full benefits)
- Mexico TAM for vehicle access (100K-300K addressable drivers × $10-14K/year): ~USD $1.0-4.2B annually

The June 2025 platform labor reform formalized gig workers under IMSS, meaning 1.26M workers now have tax records and social security history — making them more visible to credit scoring systems.

## 2. Driver Economics: EV vs. ICE

The monthly cost difference between an EV and a gasoline vehicle is the core value proposition for LAFA's drivers.

- Gasoline Magna: ~MXN $23.58-23.80/liter (Feb 2026)
- ICE driver at 4,000 km/month: MXN $7,360-11,200/month in gasoline
- EV driver (home/depot charging): MXN $800-2,400/month in electricity
- **Monthly fuel savings: MXN $5,000-10,000** (equivalent to a 25-50% income increase)

**By product:**

| Metric | Driver-as-Employee (DaE) | Lease-to-Own (LTO) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Who pays for charging | LAFA (~$300 MXN/week) | Driver |
| Driver fuel savings vs ICE | 100% (LAFA absorbs cost) | MXN $5,000-10,000/month |
| Min. weekly billing / earning | $6,000 MXN/week (billing to LAFA) | Up to $40,000 MXN/month (driver keeps earnings) |
| EV savings accrue to | LAFA (competitive cost vs ICE fleet) | Driver directly (major selling point) |

For LTO drivers, the fuel savings alone can cover 30-60% of their monthly lease payment — this is the financial engine that makes the product viable.

## 3. EV Regulatory Incentives (Mexico)

Multiple government incentives make EVs cheaper to operate than ICE vehicles, particularly for high-mileage gig drivers:

- **ISAN exemption** — Impuesto Sobre Automoviles Nuevos (new vehicle acquisition tax): EVs are exempt, saving ~3-17% of vehicle price
- **Tenencia exemption** — Annual vehicle ownership tax: exempt for 5 years in multiple states
- **Hoy No Circula exemption** — EVs are exempt from driving restrictions, including environmental contingencies. For gig drivers, losing one driving day per week reduces income ~15-20%; this exemption is worth MXN $3,000-5,000/month
- **Verification exemption** — No mandatory emissions testing required
- **Free CFE dedicated meter** — For home EV charging (residential rate, not commercial)
- **Plan Mexico (2025-2026):** 86% immediate ISR (Impuesto Sobre la Renta — income tax) deduction for EV purchases + 30% tax credit for public charging infrastructure installation

These incentives disproportionately benefit fleet operators like LAFA: the ISAN exemption and 86% ISR deduction reduce effective vehicle acquisition cost, while Hoy No Circula exemption increases driver utilization and earnings.

## Implications for LAFA

- **LTO's core pitch is quantifiable:** An LTO driver saves MXN $5,000-10,000/month in fuel vs ICE. If monthly lease is ~MXN $16,000, fuel savings cover 30-60% of it. Marketing and onboarding should lead with this number, not with "EV is greener."
- **Hoy No Circula is an underused weapon:** The exemption is worth MXN $3,000-5,000/month in avoided lost income. LAFA should quantify this in every driver-facing communication — it's the second-biggest financial incentive after fuel savings.
- **IMSS formalization creates credit data:** The 2025 labor reform means gig drivers now have IMSS records and SAT fiscal data. This directly enables the warm-start credit scoring strategy (→ see [credit-scoring.md](../fintech/credit-scoring.md) §5): Belvo can now pull employment and fiscal data for drivers who were invisible 12 months ago.
- **DaE absorbs charging cost as a feature, not a bug:** At $300 MXN/week per vehicle, LAFA's charging cost is 75-80% cheaper than what an ICE fleet would pay in gasoline ($1,200-1,500/week). The DaE model converts fuel savings into a competitive cost structure rather than passing them to the driver.
- **The 658K pool is the ceiling, not the floor:** Not all gig workers drive; not all drivers want EVs; not all EV-interested drivers qualify. LAFA's realistic addressable pool in CDMX is likely 20,000-50,000 drivers. At 2,000 vehicles, LAFA would serve 4-10% of this pool — significant but not saturated.
