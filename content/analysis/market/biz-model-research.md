# Driver-as-Employee and Lease-to-Own in Latin America: The Complete Map

> *Unit economics and P&L: [thesis/04-business-model.md](../../thesis/04-business-model.md) | LAFA's solution design: [thesis/03-solution.md](../../thesis/03-solution.md)*

**The vehicle access model for platform drivers -- not formal employment -- is the dominant mobility innovation in LatAm, with over $1.5 billion invested in startups that finance vehicles for Uber, DiDi, and 99 drivers.** VEMO in Mexico is the only company at scale that combines formal driver employment with electric vehicle lease-to-own, while Moove (after acquiring Kovi) dominates the Brazilian market with 38,000 vehicles across 6 continents. The addressable market reaches **$3-10 billion annually** across the three largest economies -- Mexico ($1.0-4.2B), Brazil, and Colombia -- serving hundreds of thousands of drivers who lack vehicle access and do not qualify for traditional bank credit. The confluence of historic labor reforms (Mexico classified platform drivers as employees starting June 2025), the explosion of Chinese EVs led by BYD, and the maturation of alternative credit scoring is creating an unprecedented window of opportunity.

## The landscape: who operates what model and where

The ecosystem splits into three archetypes: pure lease-to-own (dominant), pure driver-as-employee (virtually nonexistent outside VEMO), and hybrid models. Mexico emerges as the most competitive and dynamic market, Brazil as the largest but consolidated, and Colombia as notably underserved.

**VEMO (Mexico)** is the most ambitious player in the sector across the entire region. Founded in 2021, it has raised over **$500 million ($350M equity + $150M debt)**, including a $250M Series D led by Vision Ridge Partners in September 2025. It operates four vertically integrated business lines: VEMO Conduce (600+ EVs with formally employed drivers on Uber and DiDi), VEMO Impulso (the first EV lease-to-own program in LatAm, with 3,500+ enrolled drivers — total fleet is ~2,000+ EVs), a charging network of 2,200+ stations (the largest in Mexico), and corporate fleet electrification for AB InBev, Coca-Cola FEMSA, and Cemex. Its 5-year plan envisions $1.5 billion in investment, 50,000+ EVs, and 20,000+ charging connectors. Its roll-up strategy -- acquiring Fimeco (the largest ICE lease-to-own for ride-hailing), AuHaus (charging), Engie's electromobility division, and 35South (Argentine IoT) -- positions it as LatAm's most vertically integrated player.

**OCN/OneCarNow (Mexico)**, with $86M in Series A and a Series B closed in February 2025, operates the largest gig fleet in Mexico: **5,000 vehicles** (2,000 BYD electrics) across 12 states. Its differentiator is a proprietary underwriting engine that uses ride-hailing platform performance data, income verification via open banking, and AI analysis. It reports being profitable with margins above its public peers. It plans to triple to 15,000 vehicles and expand into Brazil and the United States.

**Moove/Kovi** dominates Brazil following the all-share acquisition of Kovi in January 2025. Moove, founded in Lagos in 2020 with backing from Uber ($100M Series B), Mubadala, BlackRock, and IFC, operates **38,000 vehicles across 19 cities on 6 continents** with an ARR of ~$400M (post-Kovi integration, 2025; pre-integration 2024 figures: $275M ARR, 36,000+ vehicles). Kovi, founded in 2018 by former 99/DiDi executives and backed by Y Combinator, had raised $145M in equity and operated 12,000+ cars in Brazil and Mexico before the acquisition. Its "Drive-to-Own" model charges automatic weekly payments deducted from the driver's platform earnings, with an effective APR of 18-22%. Its alliance with Waymo to operate robotaxi fleets in Phoenix and Miami signals a transition strategy toward autonomous vehicles.

| Company | Country | Model | Total Funding | Fleet | EV Focus |
|---------|---------|-------|---------------|-------|----------|
| VEMO | Mexico | Employer + Lease-to-Own | $500M+ | 2,000+ EVs | Yes, 100% |
| OCN | Mexico | Lease-to-Own | $86M+ | 5,000 | Partial (2,000 BYD) |
| Moove/Kovi | Brazil/Global | Drive-to-Own | $750M+ | 38,000 | No, mostly ICE |
| Leasy | Peru to Mexico | Lease-to-Own | $70M+ | 500+ | No |
| Planet42 | South Africa to Mexico | Rent-to-Buy (used) | $166M+ | 16,000+ | No |
| FlexClub | South Africa to Mexico | Asset-light marketplace | $6M | Hundreds | Partial (Italika motorcycles) |
| Muverang | Colombia | EV subscription | Corp. (Bancolombia) | 1,400+ EVs | Yes, 100% |
| Cabify | Spain/LatAm | Employer (Spain only) | $400M+ | 42M users | Partial |

**Leasy (Peru to Mexico)** stands out for its proven profitability: profitable from month one, with a default rate of just **1%**, and $70M+ raised in equity and debt. It expanded to Mexico in January 2024 and is exploring Colombia and Chile. **Planet42** (Estonia/South Africa) has operated in Mexico since 2022 with a rent-to-buy model for used cars targeting the unbanked population -- not exclusively gig drivers -- with $166M+ raised and 16,000+ vehicles deployed. **Colombia is the market with the largest gap**: despite having ~1.2 million platform driver accounts and 21 million users, there is no significant lease-to-own startup for drivers. Muverang operates EV subscriptions backed by Bancolombia, Celsia, and SURA, but does not target the gig segment.

## The rules of the game: three countries, three divergent regulatory frameworks

Labor regulation for platform drivers is undergoing its most profound transformation in LatAm, with Mexico having taken the most radical step, Colombia adopting a hybrid model, and Brazil still in flux.

**Mexico enacted the world's most advanced reform** for platform drivers. Published in the DOF (Diario Oficial de la Federacion, Mexico's federal register) on December 24, 2024, and effective since June 22, 2025, the reform to Chapter IX Bis of the LFT (Ley Federal del Trabajo, the federal labor law) establishes a **subordinate employment relationship** between digital platforms and drivers during effectively worked time. Drivers are entitled to IMSS (social security), INFONAVIT (housing fund), aguinaldo (annual bonus), vacaciones (paid leave), and PTU (profit-sharing) for those accumulating more than 288 hours annually. The IMSS pilot program launched on July 1, 2025, and by August 2025 **377,305 new formal jobs** were registered in the transportation sector -- massively attributed to the reform. Total employer burden is estimated at **35-45% on base salary**, including IMSS (~24-38%), INFONAVIT (5%), SAR (retirement savings, 2%), and state payroll tax (1-4%). A critical detail for the business model: the reform explicitly classifies vehicle leasing as a **civil act**, separating it from the employment relationship.

**Colombia adopted a dual model with Law 2466 of 2025**, enacted on June 25, 2025. Platform workers can be classified as dependent (full CST -- Codigo Sustantivo del Trabajo, the labor code -- protection) or independent/autonomous, under the principle of primacy of reality. For independent workers, platforms must pay **60% of social security contributions** (health + pension) and 100% of ARL (occupational risk insurance), calculated on 40% of the worker's total income. The reform prohibits exclusivity clauses and mandates algorithmic transparency. Total employment burden in Colombia reaches **50-60% on base salary** (including EPS -- health insurance, pension, ARL, parafiscales -- payroll taxes, cesantias -- severance, prima -- mid-year bonus, and vacaciones). Platform-specific transportation regulation -- distinct from delivery -- remains in legislative process under PL 136/2024.

**Brazil remains in flux**, with two parallel processes. PLP 12/2024, signed by President Lula in March 2024, proposes creating the category of "autonomous platform worker" -- explicitly not CLT (Consolidacao das Leis do Trabalho, the formal labor code) -- with minimum compensation of **R$32.10/hour** (R$8.03 services + R$24.07 costs), shared INSS (social security: 7.5% worker + 20% platform on the services component), and a 12-hour/day per platform cap. Simultaneously, the STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal, the supreme court) has pending Tema 1291 (RE 1446336), which will establish binding precedent on employment classification for more than **10,000 suspended cases**. Oral arguments began in October 2025 but there is no date for a vote. Full CLT burden in Brazil is the highest in the region: **70-100% on base salary** (employer INSS 20%, FGTS -- severance fund -- 8%, RAT -- workplace accident insurance -- 1-3%, Sistema S ~5%, 13th salary, vacation bonus of 1/3). Uber argued before the STF that recognizing employment ties would reduce drivers by 52% and raise fares by 33%.

## A $3-10 billion LatAm market with hundreds of thousands of underserved drivers

The three markets combined represent over **$8.4 billion in ride-hailing** and **$11.4 billion in delivery** (2024), with between 3.2 and 4.3 million active drivers and couriers on platforms.

Brazil leads with ~$4.1B in ride-hailing and $8.4B+ in delivery, where iFood controls ~80% of the delivery market and Uber holds ~50-65% in ride-hailing with 1.4 million registered drivers. Mexico follows with ~$3.3-3.5B in ride-hailing (where DiDi holds ~56% and Uber ~44%) and $2.5B in delivery. Colombia reaches ~$850M in ride-hailing and $480M in delivery. Projections indicate CAGRs of **5-9% in ride-hailing** and **10-17% in delivery** through 2030.

The central data point for the investment thesis: according to IDB-Uber survey data, an estimated 40-60% of ride-hailing car drivers across LatAm lack vehicle access or depend on third-party vehicles (47% don't personally own, but 22% use family vehicles), and the vast majority cannot qualify for traditional bank credit. For **Mexico specifically**, the driver funnel narrows from 658K registered platform workers to an estimated 100K-300K addressable car-based ride-hailing drivers who need vehicle access. At per-vehicle revenue of $10,000-14,000/year (based on VEMO Impulso pricing of MXN $4,500-5,300/week and LAFA DaE billing of MXN $6,000+/week), the **Mexico TAM is $1.0-4.2 billion annually**. Extrapolating to Brazil and Colombia -- with adjustments for lower price points on used ICE vehicles (Kovi's blended ARR of ~$340/month reflected Brazil's cheaper used ICE fleet, not Mexico EV leasing) -- LatAm TAM is **$3-10 billion/year**, with the wide range reflecting honest uncertainty across markets. The car subscription market in Brazil, with current penetration below 0.5% of the 45M-unit vehicle fleet, could reach **$25 billion** if it achieves European penetration levels (10-20%).

The EV segment adds an additional layer of opportunity. EV sales in LatAm doubled in 2024 to ~4% share, led by Brazil (~125,000 units, +88.7% YoY), Mexico (~69,700, +67%), and Colombia (reaching >10% share by late 2025). BYD dominates with 74.4% of EV/hybrid sales in Brazil, 42% in Colombia, and 40,000 units in Mexico. Its factory in Camacari, Bahia (R$5,500M investment) began production in July 2025 with capacity for 150,000 vehicles/year, expandable to 600,000.

## Global benchmarks: what works and why Kovi couldn't survive alone

Successful models globally share four elements: an alliance with a dominant platform as a demand anchor, a mixed capital structure (equity + debt), embedded services (insurance, maintenance, charging), and alternative credit scoring based on trip data.

**Otto Car (UK)** demonstrates that the model can be profitable without massive venture capital. Bootstrapped with just $3.76M in external financing, it operates 5,600 vehicles (4,000 EVs) in London -- the largest electric private hire fleet in Europe -- with ~GBP 20M in revenue and GBP 12M in reported EBITDA. Its success is explained by a favorable regulator (TfL requires zero emissions for new hire vehicles) and a dense market. **Caocao (China)**, a Geely subsidiary, operates the driver-as-employee model at the largest global scale: 33,000 company-owned vehicles with employed and trained drivers, GTV of CNY 16,900M ($2,370M) in 2024 across 83 Chinese cities. Its viability depends on OEM backing (vehicles at cost) and a regulated market that rewards service quality.

**Splend (Australia)** is a cautionary tale: despite raising $500M+ (including $300M from Macquarie), it took nearly 10 years to reach 7,000 vehicles. Its expansion attempt into Mexico and Canada failed, retreating to focus on Australia and UK. The lesson is clear: **premature geographic expansion before achieving density and unit economics in the core market destroys value**.

The Moove acquisition of Kovi is the defining event for the sector in LatAm. Kovi, despite being the pioneer with $145M in equity and the largest pure fleet-for-drivers operation in Brazil, needed to merge with a global player to access sufficient capital and achieve efficient scale. This suggests that **standalone players in individual LatAm markets face a capital ceiling** that can only be overcome with global scale or deep vertical integration (the VEMO path).

## The value chain: financing, insurance, technology, and the role of fintechs

Fleet financing requires a sophisticated capital structure that combines equity for technology and operations with **debt for vehicle acquisition**. Vision Ridge Partners ($5.1B AUM in sustainable real assets) leads the investment in VEMO; Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and MUFG finance Moove's debt; IFC (World Bank) participates in both. Development banks -- BNDES (Brazil), NAFIN (Mexico), Bancoldex (Colombia) -- represent an underutilized source of cheap capital for fleets. The interest rate environment is a critical factor: Brazil operates with a **Selic rate at 15%**, Colombia at 10.25%, and Mexico at 7.75%, making the cost of capital for vehicle acquisition vary dramatically by market.

Alternative credit scoring infrastructure is maturing rapidly. **Palenca (Mexico, YC S21)** covers 115 million workers in LatAm with its income and employment verification API, counts Serasa Experian as a strategic investor, and has Kovi, Rappi, and Mercado Libre as clients. **Bankuish** generates a credit score from digital work history (Uber trips, freelance projects). **Uils (Argentina)** offers microcredits to drivers using driving history as a credit score -- the fact that **90%+ of gig drivers are rejected for traditional credit** underscores the opportunity. In insurance, vehicle penetration is extremely low (**70% of cars in Mexico have no insurance**), creating space for fleet insurance models with telematics that reduce premiums by 15-20%.

OEMs play a growing but limited role. **Kinto (Toyota)** operates in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica with corporate leasing (Kinto One) and car-sharing (Kinto Share), but its mileage limits (15,000-24,000 km/year) exclude it from the ride-hailing segment (~90,000 km/year). **BYD** is the most strategic vehicle partner: its BYD D1 (designed specifically for ride-hailing) is used by VEMO (1,000+ units) and 99 Brasil (300 units), and its alliance with Uber envisions 100,000 EVs globally. The dependence on sub-$20,000 Chinese EVs is a risk: import tariffs in Brazil reach 35% by July 2026.

## The electric equation: favorable TCO but insufficient infrastructure

For high-mileage drivers (250 km/day, ~90,000 km/year), EVs already offer significantly lower TCO than ICE, with savings of **$12,000-22,000 over 5 years** depending on the country, driven primarily by fuel costs that are 70-85% lower. In Mexico, a driver spends ~$10,650/year on gasoline vs. ~$1,500-2,500 on electricity. Maintenance is 50-60% lower. TCO parity is reached in **1.5-3 years** even without subsidies.

However, charging infrastructure remains the primary bottleneck. Brazil leads with ~12,700 charging points (577% growth in 2024), Mexico has ~3,200 stations, and Colombia has barely ~173 fast stations on highways. Only 16% of charging points in Brazil are DC fast chargers. Charging time (30-45 minutes for 80% on DC vs. 5 minutes for refueling) directly impacts driver earnings. LFP batteries (used by BYD) offer greater tolerance for tropical heat and more charge cycles, making them more suitable for the region.

Colombia has the **most aggressive government incentives in LatAm** for EVs: 70% discount on vehicle tax for electric taxis in Bogota, exemption from pico y placa (license plate-based driving restrictions), discount on SOAT (mandatory auto insurance), preferential parking, and VAT exemption. Brazil adopted the Mover program (R$19,300M in fiscal incentives through 2028) but simultaneously implemented graduated import tariffs (10% January 2024 to 35% July 2026) to force local manufacturing. Mexico offers ISR (income tax) deductions up to MXN $250,000 for EVs and import tariff exemptions, but lacks a unified national policy.

## Risks that can break the model

Three structural risks dominate: the cost of formal employment, vehicle default, and the macroeconomic environment.

**Formal driver employment creates a 35-100% cost disadvantage** versus platforms using independent contractors. In Brazil, a driver with a base salary of R$2,000 costs the employer R$3,400-4,000+/month. This gap explains why the vast majority of companies in the sector operate lease-to-own (where the driver is an independent contractor who rents the vehicle) rather than formal employment. VEMO is the notable exception, but its Conduce model (employed drivers) coexists with Impulso (independent drivers), allowing it to serve both segments. The viability of the employment model depends on the employed driver generating enough premium revenue (via higher utilization, better ratings, access to corporate trips) to offset the social burden.

Default risk is inherent to the lease-to-own model in emerging economies. However, reported rates are surprisingly low: **Leasy reports 1% default** thanks to rigorous underwriting. Key mitigations include: automatic weekly collection deducted from platform earnings (Moove), telematics with remote vehicle disabling capability, and scoring based on driver performance data. Vehicle theft is a greater risk: **450,000 vehicles stolen annually in Brazil** (50% at gunpoint) and **80,000 in Mexico**, implying insurance costs of ~5% of vehicle value and the need for advanced IoT.

The macro environment adds complexity: with **Selic at 15% in Brazil**, the cost of financing fleets is prohibitive without access to international debt or FIDC-type structures (securitization). Currency volatility makes imported EVs more expensive. Brazilian tariffs of 35% on imported EVs (effective July 2026) could radically alter the cost equation -- although BYD's local production partially mitigates this risk.

---

## Where the market is converging

The market is moving toward **full-stack vertical integration**: vehicle financing + embedded services (insurance, maintenance, charging) + platform alliance + technology (IoT/telematics/credit scoring). Single-point companies -- fleet rental only with no path to ownership, or fintech only with no vehicles -- are less defensible. Consolidation is underway: Moove acquired Kovi, VEMO executed 4 acquisitions in months. This will continue.

The major platforms will not move toward employing drivers directly. Uber invests in Moove and partners with VEMO and BYD to guarantee vehicle supply without assuming labor liability. DiDi uses ultra-low commissions (10-15% vs. ~25% for Uber) as a competitive strategy. Mexico's reform forces platforms to register drivers with IMSS, but the "effectively worked time" structure and voluntary disconnection minimize operational impact.

**Autonomous vehicles will not meaningfully impact LatAm for at least 10 years.** No regulatory framework exists in any country in the region, and global deployments are concentrated in 40-80 cities in the U.S. and China through 2035. The only signal is an L3 pilot in Sao Paulo. This gives driver + fleet models an extended runway. However, the Moove-Waymo alliance suggests that today's fleet operators are the natural operators of tomorrow's autonomous fleets.

The fintech + mobility convergence is perhaps the most transformative trend. With 90%+ of drivers rejected for traditional credit, 70% of cars uninsured in Mexico, and the proliferation of alternative scoring APIs (Palenca, Bankuish), the platform driver emerges as a massive and underserved financial segment. **The companies that control the financial relationship with the driver -- not just the vehicle -- will build the deepest moat.**

## Conclusion

The Driver-as-Employee/Lease-to-Own market in LatAm is at an inflection point defined by three converging forces. First, regulation: Mexico set a global precedent by classifying drivers as employees, creating structural demand for fleet operators that already have the infrastructure to comply with labor obligations. Second, EVs: BYD is building massive local manufacturing capacity, TCO is unequivocally favorable for high mileage, and lease-to-own models solve the upfront cost barrier. Third, financialization: alternative credit scoring, embedded finance, and securitization are unlocking capital for a segment of 2+ million drivers invisible to traditional banking.

**Colombia represents the largest uncaptured opportunity** -- a $1.3B+ market in ride-hailing and delivery, 1.2M driver accounts, aggressive EV incentives, and virtually no competitors. VEMO and Moove/Kovi are positioned as the two dominant players at the regional level, but with fundamentally different strategies: VEMO bets on deep vertical integration and EVs in Mexico; Moove on global scale and diversification toward AVs. Room for new entrants exists in Colombia, in specific niches (electric motorcycles for delivery, used cars for the mass market), and in the financial infrastructure layer (insurance, scoring, payments) that enables the entire ecosystem.
