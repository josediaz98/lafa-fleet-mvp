# LAFA: Tariff Analysis

**Last updated:** February 6, 2026
**Scope:** 50% tariff structure, impact by LAFA OEM (JAC/GAC/Geely), unit economics scenarios, exemptions, CKD cost advantage.

---

## 1. Tariff Structure (Effective January 1, 2026)

- **50% ad valorem tariff** on vehicles from countries without free trade agreements
- Previous rate: 20% (increased to 50%)
- Applies to BEVs under codigo arancelario 8703.80.01 (the customs classification code for battery electric vehicles)
- Primary target: Chinese manufacturers
- Context: Mirrors U.S. Section 301 tariffs (100% on Chinese EVs). Mexico's move partly maintains USMCA/T-MEC compliance.

**Key terms used in this document:**
- **CKD** (Completely Knocked Down): Vehicle imported as disassembled parts for local assembly, qualifying as domestically manufactured
- **CIF** (Cost, Insurance, and Freight): The total import cost including shipping and insurance, used as the base for tariff calculation
- **ISR** (Impuesto Sobre la Renta): Mexico's income tax; EVs qualify for 86% immediate deduction under Plan Mexico 2025-2026
- **ISAN** (Impuesto Sobre Automoviles Nuevos): New vehicle acquisition tax; EVs are exempt
- **GML** (Giant Motors Latinoamerica): Mexican assembly partner for JAC, operating the CKD plant in Hidalgo

## 2. Impact by LAFA OEM

**JAC — EXEMPT (LOW RISK)**

JAC vehicles assembled by Giant Motors Latinoamerica (GML) in Hidalgo qualify as Mexican-manufactured:
- Plant: Ciudad Sahagun, Hidalgo
- Capacity: currently ~30,000/year, expanding to **60,000** with MXN $3B investment
- EV capacity: 7,000+/year, scalable to 12,000
- CKD assembly with Mexican VIN = no 50% tariff
- Models assembled locally: E10X, EJ7, iEV40, various ICE

**CKD cost advantage:**
```
Importing finished vehicle: CIF ~$10-12K USD + 50% tariff = ~$15-18K USD
CKD assembly in Mexico: kit ~$7-9K + 20-35% parts tariff + $0.8-1.5K labor = ~$9.2-13.6K USD
Savings: MXN $87,000-116,000 per vehicle (25-40% cheaper)
```

**GAC — EXPOSED (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)**

- Imports directly from China (AION ES confirmed in DiDi Premier fleet)
- No known local assembly plans
- Full 50% tariff applies
- Example: GAC AION ES base ~MXN $480,000 → post-tariff ~MXN $720,000
- Monthly lease impact: +MXN $5,000/month (48-month term)

**Geely — UNKNOWN EXPOSURE (CRITICAL RESEARCH GAP)**

- Confirmed LAFA partner by Levi, but **zero analysis performed**
- Unknown: which models, whether local assembly exists, fleet proportion
- Full 50% tariff likely applies if importing from China
- **This is the single biggest intelligence gap — must confirm with JJ**

## 3. Unit Economics Under Tariff Scenarios

**Base: JAC E10X at MXN $400,000 (pre-tariff fleet price, assembled in Mexico)**

| Scenario | Vehicle Cost | Monthly Deprec. (48mo) | Lease Price | Viability |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Base (no tariff) | MXN $400,000 | MXN $8,333 | $12-14K/mo | Viable at $25K income |
| +20% cost | MXN $480,000 | MXN $10,000 | $14-16K/mo | Stressed |
| +30% cost | MXN $520,000 | MXN $10,833 | $15-17K/mo | Marginal |
| +50% tariff | MXN $600,000 | MXN $12,500 | $17-19K/mo | **NOT viable** |

**Lease-to-Own model breakdown at +50% tariff:**
- Monthly payment: ~MXN $16,695 (at 15% annual financing cost)
- Driver's savings vs. ICE: ~MXN $8,000-13,000/month
- Net monthly benefit: **-MXN $3,695 to -MXN $8,695** — value proposition destroyed

**Strategic imperative:** Maximize JAC Mexico-assembled vehicles. Clarify Geely exposure immediately. For GAC, evaluate pre-tariff inventory or alternative sourcing. *→ For OEM partner summary, see [05-traction.md](../../thesis/05-traction.md).*

**Silver lining:** Tariffs increase used EV residual values (fewer cheap new EVs entering market), improving LAFA's balance sheet on existing fleet.

## 4. Exemptions & Workarounds

- **T-MEC/USMCA:** Vehicles with 75%+ regional value content are exempt. JAC CKD assembly likely qualifies.
- **CKD classification risk:** If Mexico classifies CKD kits as "essentially complete vehicles," the 50% tariff could apply to kits too.
- **Free Trade Zones:** Mexico's special economic zones (Tabasco, Chiapas, Oaxaca) are NOT designed for automotive.
- **IMMEX:** Allows duty-free import of components for assembly and re-export, but domestic sales still face tariffs.

## 5. Unit Economics (Estimated per Vehicle/Month)

| Concept | Estimate (MXN) |
|---------|---------------|
| Revenue: vehicle lease | $10,000-16,000 |
| Revenue: charging margin | $500-1,500 |
| Revenue: insurance margin | $200-500 |
| **Revenue total** | **$10,700-18,000** |
| Cost: depreciation (48 months) | $7,500-10,000 |
| Cost: insurance (todo riesgo) | $1,500-3,000 |
| Cost: maintenance | $500-1,000 |
| Cost: charging infrastructure | $200-500 |
| Cost: GPS/telematics | $100-300 |
| Cost: admin/operations | $500-1,000 |
| Cost: cost of capital (debt) | $1,000-2,000 |
| **Cost total** | **$11,300-17,800** |
| **Contribution margin** | **-$600 to +$2,000** |

Margins improve with: (a) OEM volume discounts (10-20%), (b) low default rates, (c) vehicle utilization >90% (~2.5 drivers per vehicle), (d) strong residual values. Break-even per vehicle: ~18-30 months. Fiscal incentives help: 86% immediate deduction of EV cost (ISR), ISAN exemption, 30% tax credit for charging infrastructure.

## Implications for LAFA

- **Prioritize JAC for fleet growth.** JAC is the only OEM exempt from the 50% tariff thanks to CKD assembly in Hidalgo. Target: >60% of new fleet additions in 2026 should be JAC. Each JAC vehicle saves MXN $87,000-116,000 vs. an equivalent imported vehicle.
- **Urgently confirm with JJ: does Geely have local assembly?** If the answer is NO, limit Geely to <20% of new fleet additions. If Geely imports directly from China, the cost per vehicle rises ~MXN $87,000-116,000, destroying the margin on that segment.
- **GAC: only viable with pre-tariff inventory.** Do not acquire new GAC vehicles until CKD or an exemption exists. Example: a GAC AION ES goes from MXN $480,000 to MXN $720,000 post-tariff -- a lease impact of +MXN $5,000/month that eliminates viability.
- **Model the risk scenario:** If 50% of the fleet were imported Geely at full price, the contribution margin drops from +MXN $2,000 to -MXN $600/vehicle/month. This scenario must be on the table before the interview with JJ.
- **Leverage the residual value tailwind:** The 50% tariffs reduce the inflow of cheap new EVs, which increases the resale value of the existing fleet. This improves LAFA's balance sheet and strengthens the LTO proposition (the driver receives a vehicle worth more than expected at the end of the lease).
