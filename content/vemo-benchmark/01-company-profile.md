## 1. Business Model: Four Verticals

Vemo's core thesis: **emerging markets require full vertical integration** — you can't unbundle fleets, charging, and technology the way developed markets can. "In the US, you can sell the lid of a salt shaker and have a $100 million business. Here, to sell the lid, you have to build the restaurant."

| Vertical | Description | Key Details |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Vemo Conduce** (DaE) | Company-owned EVs, company-employed drivers on Uber | 650+ EVs, 1,500+ drivers, 18 hrs/day, 400-420 km/day per vehicle |
| **Vemo Impulso** (LTO) | Lease-to-own for independent ridehail drivers | Acquired existing ICE leasing company (Fimeco), transitioning to EV. See [02-impulso-financing.md](02-impulso-financing.md) |
| **Corporate Fleet Transition** | Route analysis, vehicle selection, charging infra, fleet management for enterprises | Santander financing partnership. Clients: Bimbo, 99 Minutos, Metrobus |
| **Charging Network** | Public + semi-public charging infrastructure | ~500 chargers, targeting 1,000+. See [03-charging-infrastructure.md](03-charging-infrastructure.md) |

**Fleet mix**: 60-70%+ is leased (Impulso) — Rocha identifies this as the biggest growth opportunity.

**Flywheel logic**: More leased vehicles → more charging demand → more network utilization → better unit economics across all verticals. None of these verticals is independently viable in a market lacking EV ecosystem infrastructure — but together they create a self-reinforcing system.

> "No podiamos poner un negocio de flotas electricas si no habia recarga, pero tampoco podemos hacer un negocio rentable de infraestructura si no teniamos flotas."

**Why not build a ride-hailing app?** Explicitly rejected: "These companies have spent billions building not just technology but the customer base." Vemo operates on Uber's platform instead.

## 2. Scale Metrics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Fleet size (Conduce) | ~650 EVs (podcast data); 2,000+ EVs (latest per competitive-landscape.md) | El Broadcast; thesis update |
| Drivers (Conduce) | 1,500-1,600 | El Broadcast |
| Total employees | ~2,000 | Cracks Podcast |
| Km logged | 75 million | Cracks Podcast |
| Daily utilization | 400-420 km/vehicle, 18 hrs/day, 2 shifts | El Broadcast |
| Public chargers | ~500 (targeting 1,000+) | Imagen Empresarial |
| Cities (Impulso) | 5 (CDMX, Tijuana, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Queretaro) | VEMO Talks #2 |
| Impulso financings | 2,500+ historical, 100 active | VEMO Talks #2 |
| Electric buses | 10 articulated on Metrobus Line 3 | El Broadcast |

**Operational claim**: "We operate the most km-intensive fleet not just in LatAm but in the Western world."

## 3. OEM Relationships

| OEM | Vehicle Type | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **BYD** | EVs (fleet + lease) | First BYDs in Mexico were Vemo imports. BYD-certified workshops. Charging partnership (GB/T standard) |
| **JAC** | EVs | Shared with LAFA |
| **GAC** | EVs | Shared with LAFA |
| **Yutong** | Electric buses | Metrobus fleet — diversification beyond ride-hail |

- Vemo visited BYD in China early, impressed by the operation, imported directly
- Built first independent EV-certified maintenance workshops in Mexico (their claim)
- Key hire: **Nacho** (ex-Pepsico, managed 20,000+ vehicles, 700 workshops, 300 mechanics)
- **Tesla rejected**: Wouldn't allow third-party workshops; Vemo needed 400-420 km/day turnaround

**LAFA gap**: LAFA has Geely (which Vemo doesn't mention) but lacks BYD — the market leader.

## 4. Capital Architecture

| Investor | Amount | Type | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| **Riverstone** | Anchor (undisclosed) | PE | Energy-focused PE; German Losada was on founding team. $2B raised in LatAm total |
| **OYC** | $60M USD | Credit line | New York fund; raised ~1 year before podcast |
| **Other investors** | ~$65M USD equiv. (pesos) | Various | Additional rounds |
| **Total estimated** | **$150M+** | | |

- **PE over VC deliberately**: Business is capital-intensive, needs patient long-horizon investors
- Afores (Mexican pension funds) have indirect exposure via Riverstone
- Monthly board meetings, quarterly reviews
- "The worst thing is having an investor who expects things based on their profile when your plan and market reality are different"

**LAFA gap**: This is arguably the **biggest gap**. Vemo has $150M+ from sophisticated energy investors. LAFA's fundraising appears to be an order of magnitude smaller.

## 5. Operations

### Utilization & Workshops
- 400-420 km/day per vehicle across 2 shifts (18 hrs/day, 7 days/week)
- Specialized EV-certified maintenance workshops — competitive moat for speed and cost
- Nacho (ex-Pepsico) manages workshop operations

### Safety & Monitoring
- C2 monitoring center with real-time GPS + driver communication
- Panic buttons in all vehicles
- Norwegian fire blankets for battery emergencies
- Zero-tolerance alcohol policy (breathalyzer every shift)
- Dedicated QHSE team with ex-Schlumberger lead
- ~80% driver approval rate in training program
- Full details: [04-fleet-safety.md](04-fleet-safety.md)

### Technology
- "Watts by Vemo" charging app (consumer-facing brand)
- Fleet management software: battery monitoring, driver behavior, emissions tracking
- Near-term plan: spin out fleet management software as standalone SaaS for export to Brazil
- Vemo describes "monitoring platform" but **doesn't elaborate on AI/ML capabilities**

---

## 6. Market Context

### Mexico EV Market
- 500 EVs sold in 2020 → ~80,000 in 2024 (160x growth)
- 10 EV models under $500K MXN, 3 under $400K MXN — all Chinese
- Battery = 30-40% of EV cost; China dominates supply chain

### Geopolitics & Tariffs
- 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in US (May 2024) and Canada threatens Mexico
- "If tariffs reach 100%, they destroy the electromobility project in the country"
- Mexico's positioning could attract nearshoring of Chinese EV manufacturing
- Vemo's government relationships (Riverstone portfolio, Metrobus contract) give lobbying advantage

### High-Utilization Thesis
EVs deliver compounding returns in high-utilization, high-occupancy sectors (ride-hailing, transit, logistics). A private car driven 2-3 hrs/day gains little from electrification — the cost premium doesn't justify the marginal savings. Fleet vehicles running 12-16 hrs/day maximize the TCO advantage. This framework (from sustainable mobility research) validates both Vemo's and LAFA's fleet-first approach.

## 7. Culture & Hiring

- **"Play to win, not to participate"** — core value
- **Personality over CV**: "When candidates arrive, we don't look at the CV, we don't look at prior experience. We focus purely and exclusively on personality."
- Growth mindset (Carol Dweck): curiosity, discipline, hunger
- "Diamond to polish" approach: promote internal talent before they feel ready
- No external recruiters — all talent sourced through network
- High Potential ("JAPO") program for top performers: CEO speakers, specialized training, accelerated responsibility
- Post-acquisition: integrated 4 companies in first 90 days + Bit at month 12. Used grief-work facilitation for cultural integration

---

## 8. Strategic Outlook

### IPO Timeline
- "One of the alternatives we strongly consider is a listing" — 3-5 years (2028-2030)
- Permanent capital for long-term growth; 10-15-20 year founder commitment
- Brazil mentioned as future expansion (not imminent)
- Colombia operations inherited from Bit acquisition, deprioritized vs. Mexico

### Software SaaS Pivot
- Fleet management software (battery monitoring, driver behavior, emissions) being spun out as standalone SaaS
- Target: exportable to Brazil and beyond
- Status: "hatching" — no evidence of PMF, pricing, or competitive landscape yet

## 9. Competitive Scorecard: Vemo vs. LAFA

| Dimension | Vemo | LAFA | Advantage |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|
| Fleet size | 2,000+ EVs | ~150 EVs | Vemo (~13x) |
| Drivers | 1,500+ (Conduce alone) | Smaller | Vemo |
| Capital raised | ~$150M+ | Substantially less | Vemo |
| OEMs | BYD, JAC, GAC, Yutong | Geely, JAC, GAC | Vemo (BYD) |
| Platform | Uber | DiDi | Neutral (different bets) |
| Charging infra | Own vertical (500+ chargers) | Pays for charging | Vemo |
| Technology/AI | Monitoring (vague) | Stage 0 but AI roadmap | **LAFA (potential)** |
| Workshops | Certified, in-house | Unknown | Vemo |
| Products | Conduce + Impulso + Buses + Corporate | DaE + LTO | Vemo (diversified) |
| Govt relationships | Metrobus contract, Riverstone political capital | Unknown | Vemo |
| Tariff hedges | No specific hedge mentioned | JAC exempt (Hidalgo) | **LAFA (JAC)** |
| Team size | ~2,000 total | ~3 tech planned | Vemo |
| IPO path | 3-5 years | Not discussed | Vemo |

### LAFA's Best Path
Win on **AI/data intelligence** (Vemo's weakest area), **DiDi exclusivity** (different platform bet), **Geely relationship** (OEM Vemo doesn't have), and **speed of tech buildout** (Stage 0 → operational platform before Vemo's next capital raise).

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Map Vemo's charging infrastructure footprint — depot locations, commercial installations, driver lock-in effects
- [ ] Clarify Geely tariff status — LAFA's biggest OEM knowledge gap; could be differentiation or risk
- [ ] Benchmark driver economics: Vemo operates 18hr/day at 400-420 km/day — how does LAFA compare?

### Strategic
- [ ] DiDi vs. Uber platform risk — if one gains CDMX dominance, this is existential
- [ ] Evaluate charging infrastructure strategy — own, partner, or stay cost-taker?
- [ ] Monitor Vemo IPO timeline — if they go public, the capital asymmetry becomes permanent
- [ ] Build the technology layer Vemo hasn't — monitoring + AI/ML could leapfrog their vague "monitoring platform"

## Critical Gaps

1. **No financial specifics** — profitability claims unverified; no revenue, unit economics, or burn rate
2. **Driver satisfaction unknown** — no data on churn, complaints, working conditions despite 1,500+ drivers
3. **Technology platform vaguely described** — "monitoring" mentioned but no specifics on capabilities
4. **Impulso scale unclear** — 2,500 historical / 100 active suggests significant portfolio lifecycle questions
5. **All sources are promotional** — founders telling their story to friendly hosts; no adversarial questioning
6. **DiDi relationship unexplored** — Vemo is all-in on Uber; stance on DiDi unclear
