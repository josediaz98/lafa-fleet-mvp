## 1. Vertical Integration Thesis: "Build the Restaurant"

In developed markets (US, Europe, Norway), each layer of the EV ecosystem has standalone operators — charging companies, fleet companies, technology providers. You can specialize and build a $100M business selling "the lid of a salt shaker."

In emerging markets, that fragmentation doesn't work. There are no subsidies, no existing charging networks, no regulatory push to phase out combustion. You need to build the entire ecosystem yourself.

> "En Estados Unidos quieres vender la tapa de un salero y tienes un negocio de $100M. Aqui para vender la tapa del salero tienes que poner el restaurante."

**The chicken-and-egg**: You can't run an EV fleet without charging infrastructure, but you can't build profitable charging infrastructure without guaranteed utilization from fleets. Neither vertical alone pencils out.

**Investor reaction**: Split. An Indian fund investor validated immediately ("Obviously you need everything"). A US investor framed it as binary: "You have the best business model I've seen in electromobility — or you're completely crazy."

**Framework framing**: "Complicated vs. Complex" — complicated problems have a roadmap somewhere; complex problems have no manual, no benchmark anywhere in the world.

> **[LAFA]** LAFA is pursuing the fleet verticals (Conduce + Impulso) WITHOUT charging infrastructure. If Rocha is right that integration is necessary in LatAm, LAFA faces a structural disadvantage. If LAFA can access charging without owning it (partnerships, depot arrangements), it might achieve the same outcome with less capital. This is the central strategic question.

## 2. Growth Discipline: The Rojas Step-Function

Carlos Rojas (founder of Rotoplas, one of Mexico's most respected operators) delivered the foundational corrective:

> "Tu has tenido una carrera muy buena, pero tu no has sido operador, y operar es otra cosa. Tienes que sentarte a pensar bien en los temas de la operacion."

Then Rojas drew a growth curve — **not** a hockey stick, but a **step function**:

1. Grow to a certain point
2. **Stop**
3. Stabilize
4. Consolidate and learn
5. Then grow again

> "La curva no es asi — la curva es asi, y luego asi."

**Why this matters in asset-heavy businesses**: Growth creates complexity nonlinearly. Every new vehicle requires maintenance scheduling, driver management, charging logistics, insurance, and compliance. Scale before your processes can absorb this complexity → negative customer experiences, employee churn, and unit economic deterioration harder to fix at scale than prevent at smaller size.

Rocha followed this: grew Vemo Conduce to a certain fleet size, stabilized operations, then re-accelerated. The opposite of blitzscaling.

> **[LAFA]** LAFA is targeting 13x growth (150 → 2,000 vehicles) in one year. The Rojas framework asks: where are the natural plateaus? What breaks at 500 vehicles that didn't break at 150? What breaks at 1,000 that didn't at 500? Defining "stabilize, consolidate, then re-accelerate" milestones could prevent the operational debt that kills high-growth physical businesses.

## 3. Partner Evaluation: Trust Transfer + Temporal Alignment

### Trust Transfer
Traditional reference checks are nearly useless for high-stakes decisions — referees have nothing to gain from candor and everything to lose from controversy. Instead, Rocha relies on **"transferencia de confianza"**: mutual connections who vouch for both parties with genuine skin in the game.

> "La transferencia de confianza es una herramienta muy util... pero realmente tienes que confiar en la persona que te lo recomendo."

**Why it works**: Accountability through relationship density. The intermediary's relationship with both parties is at stake, creating a natural filter where only high-conviction endorsements survive.

### Temporal Alignment
Surface-level assessment (capabilities, track record, enthusiasm) is insufficient. What matters is whether incentives stay aligned **over time**.

Rocha evaluates partners on four axes:
1. **Capability and track record**
2. **Integrity and transparency** — is their stated agenda their real agenda?
3. **Passion and drive** for the specific mission
4. **Temporal alignment** — will their incentives track yours through ups and downs?

The failure mode: partners aligned on returns but divergent on *purpose*. Some want to create value; others want to build an empire for its own sake. Invisible at the start, lethal at scale.

> "Tienes que entender si estan alineados contigo hoy, pero si van a estar alineados contigo manana y pasado manana."

> **[LAFA]** Directly relevant to evaluating JJ as a CEO to bet your career on. Key questions: Is JJ's agenda transparent? What is his incentive structure beyond LAFA's success (e.g., obligations to Chinese OEM partners, personal timeline)? The fact that JJ works directly with China and isn't CDMX-based introduces potential alignment divergence.

## 4. "Penthouse & Field" Cross-Pollination

Rocha lived simultaneously in **"el Penthouse y la cancha"** — evaluating billion-dollar deals at Temasek's offices while spending weekends scouting microfinance branch locations in Estado de Mexico with Alan Cherem (Financiera Contigo).

**From the Penthouse → the Field**: Insistence on audited financials, professional CFO, understanding that financial businesses must demonstrate profitability while growing.

**From the Field → the Penthouse**: Operational intuition — businesses start on the ground, you can't wait for perfect systems before launching, the first disbursement might literally be cash in a bag.

> "El primer desembolso... yo se lo di en una bolsa porque lo habia sacado en cash para que el fuera a hacer el reparto."

**The principle**: Most professionals spend their careers in one world. The rare individual who inhabits both develops calibrated judgment about when to apply Penthouse standards (financial discipline, governance) and when to accept Field realities (launching with spreadsheets, improvising logistics).

> "Cuando estas en una etapa temprana no puedes tener el mejor sistema... vas a empezar a desembolsar en efectivo y asi tienes que arrancar."

> **[LAFA]** LAFA is in the "Field" stage — everything is spreadsheets. Rocha's Contigo experience shows this can work... but NOT having visibility into unit economics while scaling 13x is how companies die. The role Jose would fill is precisely bringing Penthouse discipline to the Field before scale outstrips manual management.

## 5. Profitability in Financial Businesses

From advising Financiera Contigo, Rocha internalized a non-negotiable rule: **you cannot grow faster than your ability to generate profits** in any business with financial characteristics.

> "No vamos a poder construir un negocio financiero sostenible si no empezamos a generar utilidades. Porque en los negocios financieros, cuando te va bien necesitan lana, y cuando te va mal tambien."

**The failure mode**: A financial institution with an expensive operating model that shows reasonable profitability at current scale but can't grow profitably. When you try to build the IPO story, the narrative collapses because the growth-profitability equation doesn't work.

**Applied to Vemo**: Vemo Impulso had to wait until the right vehicle (electric), the right platform terms, and the right charging infrastructure were in place. Corporate fleets have 3-6 month sales cycles but sell leases to Santander (balance sheet efficiency) while retaining higher-margin infrastructure and software.

> **[LAFA]** LAFA is essentially a financial business — it owns/leases vehicles and collects revenue from drivers. With ~150 vehicles and a 2,000 target, unit economics must work NOW before scaling. The "everything is spreadsheets" situation makes verification impossible — hence Track A foundation urgency.

## 6. Culture & Hiring Philosophy

### Equity as Biological Imperative
Rocha references Frans de Waal's capuchin monkey experiment: two monkeys perform the same task; one receives a grape, the other a cucumber. The cucumber monkey rejects it and throws it at the experimenter.

**Lesson**: You cannot give different rewards to people contributing equally, and you cannot give equal rewards to people contributing unequally. Both violations trigger primal injustice.

### High Potential ("JAPO") Program
Identifies employees with exceptional performance AND cultural alignment. These receive: CEO guest speakers, specialized training, accelerated responsibility. Logic: high performers who don't receive recognition will leave, creating a vacuum more expensive than the development investment.

### Post-Acquisition Integration
Vemo acquired 4 companies in first 90 days + Bit at month 12. Cultural integration specialist Panchi Lanus introduced **grief work**: acknowledging what each founder loses (independent identity, their way of doing things) before building something new.

The practical challenge: founders accustomed to being generalists learning to delegate to specialists. Economic alignment was never the problem — psychological control was.

> **[LAFA]** If LAFA executes 2,000-vehicle growth, integration challenges are inevitable — whether through acquisitions or organizational growing pains. Economic alignment (equity, bonuses) is necessary but not sufficient.
