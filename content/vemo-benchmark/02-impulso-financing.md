## 1. The Problem Impulso Solves

Ridehail drivers face three interlocking barriers to EV adoption:

1. **No access to traditional credit**: No formal income proof, no down payment savings, negative credit bureau histories
2. **Higher acquisition cost**: EV vehicles cost more upfront than ICE equivalents
3. **Charging infrastructure access**: Proximity, speed, and home installation are all barriers

> "Los conductores no cuentan con comprobantes de ingreso formales, muchas veces no tienen dinero para dar un enganche, y pueden tener historiales negativos en el buro de credito." — Aaron Science

## 2. Non-Traditional Credit Scoring

Impulso goes beyond credit bureau data to assess driver risk:

- **Platform work experience**: How long they've been driving, which platforms
- **Driving hours and patterns**: Consistency, reliability signals
- **Earnings data**: Income patterns from platform activity
- **Behavioral signals**: Broader assessment beyond financial history

**The pricing insight**: Overpriced lending comes from two failures — (1) the lender doesn't understand the real risk and prices too high out of ignorance, or (2) predatory lending where the lender knows the driver has no alternatives. Impulso claims to solve for #1 through deeper risk understanding.

> "De nada sirve tener un producto de financiamiento demasiado caro... la financiera no entiende el riesgo real del cliente y haga un pricing demasiado alto por falta de informacion, o que pueda ser una financiera abusiva que sabe que el cliente no tiene otra opcion." — Aaron Science

> **[LAFA]** Validates LAFA's planned credit scoring project (Month 6-8 in ai-roadmap.md). LAFA has an advantage here: DaE drivers generate months of operational data before transitioning to LTO, enabling a "warm start" for credit models that Impulso must solve cold.

## 3. Full-Ecosystem Product (Bundled)

Impulso bundles everything a driver needs into a single product — eliminating friction at every step:

| Component | What's Included |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Financing** | No down payment required |
| **Paperwork** | Vehicle registration and legal paperwork included |
| **Insurance** | Bundled in the product |
| **Telematics** | Vehicle, battery, and charger monitoring |
| **Maintenance** | Preventive maintenance included (zero out-of-pocket) |
| **Substitute vehicles** | Replacement vehicle during accidents/service — "es un credito productivo, nunca paren de generar ingresos" |
| **Home charger** | Installation when possible |
| **Charging access** | Fast-charging network via app across the city |

**Design philosophy**: "Understanding the sector and the customer is the only way to design something tailored to them."

> **[LAFA]** This ecosystem approach is the benchmark for LAFA's LTO product. Key gaps in LAFA's current offering:
> - **Telematics bundled from day one** (LAFA currently has no telematics)
> - **Substitute vehicles** to prevent income loss (DaE handles this via fleet; LTO needs it too)
> - **Charging network via app** (LAFA pays centrally for DaE; LTO drivers need infrastructure access)

## 4. Driver Economics

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Energy cost | **1/3 of fuel costs** (electric vs. gasoline) |
| Maintenance/repair | **50% lower** (simpler motor, fewer parts) |
| Net take-home income | **+20%** increase for drivers |
| Daily km | 200+ km/day (ridehail drivers) — 4-5x private vehicle utilization |

The high utilization is what makes the economics work: ridehail drivers cover enough daily km to maximize EV savings over ICE, justifying the higher vehicle acquisition cost.

> **[LAFA]** LAFA's DaE drivers have a minimum $6K MXN/week billing requirement; LTO drivers can earn up to $40K MXN/month. These figures should be compared against Impulso's +20% income claim to validate LAFA's competitive positioning.

## 5. Scale & Geography

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Historical financings | 2,500+ total |
| Active financings | ~100 |
| CDMX share | ~50% of portfolio |
| Other cities | Tijuana, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Queretaro |
| Expansion | Entering new cities |

**Background**: Impulso originated from VEMO's acquisition of Fimeco — a company founded by Aaron Science and Alex Rosete with 7-8 years of experience leasing combustion vehicles to Uber drivers. Now transitioning the portfolio from ICE to hybrid and electric.

> **[LAFA]** The 2,500 historical → 100 active ratio raises questions. Possible explanations: (1) most historical financings were ICE vehicles under Fimeco that have completed their term, (2) significant churn/default, (3) intentional portfolio wind-down during EV transition. Worth investigating — the answer matters for understanding LTO portfolio dynamics.

## 6. Gender & Inclusion Considerations

- Women have much lower ridehail penetration
- Products designed around 12-hour workdays don't fit mothers' schedules
- Need: financing products that **don't require full-time platform work** for women
- Aaron has explored alliances with mobility platforms to foster women's access

> **[LAFA]** LAFA's DaE model (formal employment with benefits) is actually a stronger inclusion stance than financing-only. But LTO will face the same design challenge: can the product work for part-time drivers, women, or drivers with non-standard schedules?

## Comparison: Vemo Impulso vs. LAFA LTO

| Dimension | Vemo Impulso | LAFA LTO |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Model | Fintech / lease-to-own | Lease-to-own (structure unclear) |
| Credit scoring | Non-traditional (platform data, behavioral) | Planned (P2, Track C — Month 7-9), warm start from DaE data |
| Bundling | Full ecosystem (insurance, maintenance, telematics, charging, substitute vehicles) | Currently basic |
| Telematics | Bundled from day one | No telematics (Track A gap) |
| Scale | 2,500 historical / 100 active / 5 cities | Part of ~150 total fleet |
| OEM history | 7-8 years ICE leasing, transitioning to EV | EV-native from start |
| Platform | Uber | DiDi |
| Driver income boost | +20% claimed | Up to $40K MXN/month claimed |
| Substitute vehicles | Yes (prevent income loss) | DaE has fleet backup; LTO needs this |
| Down payment | None required | Unknown |

**LAFA's advantage**: DaE drivers generate months of behavioral + operational data before any LTO transition, enabling better credit decisions. Impulso must solve credit scoring cold for new applicants.

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Deep-dive Impulso's product structure as benchmark for LAFA's LTO design
- [ ] Compare Vemo's telematics bundling with LAFA's planned telemetry (Track A, P4)
- [ ] Investigate the 2,500 historical → 100 active ratio (churn? maturity? wind-down?)

### Short-term
- [ ] Design LAFA's LTO credit scoring model informed by Impulso's non-traditional approach
- [ ] Evaluate substitute vehicle program for LTO drivers
- [ ] Map LAFA's charging strategy for LTO against Impulso's app-based fast-charging model

### Strategic
- [ ] Consider gender-inclusive product design for LTO (part-time profiles, flexible payments)
- [ ] Assess "just transition" framing for impact investor narrative
