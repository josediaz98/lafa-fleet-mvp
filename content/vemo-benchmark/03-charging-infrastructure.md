## 1. Network Scale & Growth

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Public chargers | ~500 | ~1,000 (by end of 2025) |
| Private/dedicated chargers | Additional (undisclosed) | — |
| BMW contribution | 114 chargers across ~20 locations | ~5 chargers per site |
| Growth rate | 2x this year | — |

### Mexico Charging Market Context
- **~40,000 total charge points installed** in Mexico (including residential/private)
- **~3,000 are public** access
- Many are **non-smart and potentially non-functional** (installed years ago, no remote monitoring)
- Rocha estimates **2,000-2,500 actually functioning** public chargers in Mexico
- **Vemo with 500 chargers controls ~20-25% of the functional public network**
- 1,000-charger target would give them **~33-40% of the functional public network**

## 2. Charging Standards in Mexico

| Standard | Market Share | Vehicles | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **NACS** | ~40% | Tesla | Tesla deployed its own network |
| **CCS1** | ~50% | US + European brands (BMW, etc.) | Dominant standard currently |
| **GB/T** | ~10% | Chinese brands (BYD, JAC, etc.) | Growing fast with Chinese imports |

### Interoperability
- **AC chargers** (7-9 kW): High interoperability across standards with simple adapters (often factory-included)
- **DC chargers** (25-30 kW+): More complex — requires sophisticated adapters
- **US convergence**: NACS and CCS1 converging (cross-compatibility agreements); doesn't apply to GB/T

### Rocha's Regulatory Position
- Market should decide the standard, not regulation
- Forcing one standard would disrupt Chinese supply chains and prices
- Three incompatible DC standards coexisting creates friction but also opportunity for multi-standard operators

> **[LAFA]** LAFA's OEMs (Geely, JAC, GAC) likely use GB/T standard — currently ~10% of infrastructure vs. rapidly growing Chinese vehicle imports. GB/T is the most underserved standard. Vemo's BYD-GB/T partnership means Vemo is building infrastructure that directly serves the vehicle segment LAFA operates in.

## 3. Partnership Playbook

| Partner | Chargers | Standard | Strategic Value |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **BMW** | 114 across ~20 locations | CCS1 | Premium infrastructure; BMW co-investment; BMW gives kWh credits to customers; open to public via Watts app |
| **BYD** | Undisclosed | GB/T | Serves fastest-growing vehicle segment (Chinese EVs); recently inaugurated first joint charging center |
| **Siemens** | 6 highway points | DC (high power) | Highway corridor network; intercity travel enablement |

**Pattern**: Vemo positions itself as **infrastructure partner for OEMs/tech companies** who share interest in growing charging access. Each alliance is standard-aware:
- BMW = CCS/European premium
- BYD = GB/T/Chinese mass market
- Siemens = hardware-agnostic fast-charge

All chargers accessible via **Watts by Vemo** app regardless of partnership origin.

### Location Strategy
- Urban zones & shopping malls
- Commercial establishments & clubs
- Purpose-built "electrolineras" (high-density charging hubs)
- Highways (Siemens — fast-charge for intercity)
- Locations chosen based on demand data, convenience, and app accessibility

> **[LAFA]** Vemo's OEM partnerships are for **infrastructure co-investment** (BMW, BYD). LAFA's OEM partnerships are for **vehicle procurement** (Geely, JAC, GAC). These are complementary, not competing — LAFA could potentially use Vemo's charging network while sourcing vehicles from different OEMs.

## 4. Revenue Model

- **Cannot sell electricity above regulated price** (CFE regulation)
- **Revenue model**: Charge for the *service* (access to charging infrastructure), not the electricity itself
- **Location agreements**: Deals with property owners (malls, hospitals, clubs, restaurants, highway stops)
- **Pricing**: Based on utilization/usage of the service
- Shared investment burden across OEMs, tech companies, and real estate partners

> **[LAFA]** This regulatory structure (charging for service, not kWh) affects margin structure for any charging-dependent business. LAFA pays ~$300 MXN/week per vehicle for charging. At 2,000 vehicles, that's ~$600K MXN/week (~$31.2M MXN/year). Understanding Vemo's fleet pricing could inform a partnership negotiation.

## 5. Battery Swap: Explicitly Rejected

Rocha explicitly rejected the battery-swap model (NIO-style):
- **"Not scalable"** — even in China, only regionalized adoption
- **Too expensive** to build swap infrastructure
- **Restricted to specific vehicle models** — requires OEM agreements that are "difficult to implement"
- **Vemo's bet**: Better batteries + faster charging is the path, not swapping
- Future: vehicles with shorter charge times + higher durability batteries

> "We don't see the battery swap model as scalable... it's very expensive, difficult, restricted to specific vehicles."

---

## 6. Regulatory Advocacy: EMA

- Vemo co-founded **EMA (Electromovilidad Asociacion)** with other sector companies
- Mission: Support public policy development for orderly EV growth
- Generate awareness and data for policymakers
- Advocate for regulation that enables accelerated but ordered growth
- Industry development has **outpaced regulation** — infrastructure built before processes were formalized

### Regulatory Environment
- Generally "operating well" but with "areas of opportunity" in:
  - Permit processes
  - Timelines
  - Bureaucratic tramites

> **[LAFA]** EMA is worth monitoring — if Vemo leads the industry association, they shape the regulatory environment. LAFA should consider joining EMA or similar bodies to have a voice in fleet/driver regulation.

## 7. Infrastructure-First vs. Driver-Economics-First

Vemo and LAFA have **fundamentally different theses**:

| | Vemo | LAFA |
|---|------|------|
| **Core thesis** | Infrastructure-first: build charging so adoption follows | Driver-economics-first: make EV cheaper to operate for gig drivers |
| **Approach** | Enabler platform + fleet operator | Fleet operator + fintech layer |
| **Charging** | Own and operate | Pay as cost |
| **Risk if wrong** | Over-invested in infrastructure that others build | Dependent on third-party infrastructure at scale |

**Vemo's risk for LAFA**: If Vemo's infrastructure makes it easy for any driver to go EV independently, the value of LAFA's fleet management diminishes.

**LAFA's advantage**: Deep driver relationship, financing, employment model, and operational support that infrastructure alone doesn't provide.

**Potential synergy**: LAFA uses Vemo's charging network at fleet rates while focusing resources on the driver-economics layer.

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Map Vemo's Watts app charger locations in CDMX — overlap with LAFA driver routes?
- [ ] Clarify GB/T charger access — can LAFA vehicles (Geely/JAC/GAC) use Vemo's BYD-GB/T chargers via Watts?
- [ ] Quantify charging cost at scale: 2,000 vehicles x $300 MXN/week = $31.2M MXN/year

### Short-term
- [ ] Investigate EMA membership — could LAFA participate to shape policy?
- [ ] Evaluate charging partnership with Vemo — negotiate fleet rates on their network
- [ ] Monitor GB/T infrastructure buildout in CDMX (fastest-growing standard)

### Strategic
- [ ] Decide: own charging, partner for charging, or stay cost-taker as fleet scales?
- [ ] Track Vemo's 500 → 1,000 charger expansion for competitive positioning
- [ ] Differentiation clarity: LAFA's moat is driver economics + employment model, not infrastructure
