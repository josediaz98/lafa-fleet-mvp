## 1. Executive summary

Jianan Jiang is a **founder-CEO** and former growth and data science leader in consumer finance who is now building an EV and fast-charging network startup in Mexico (LAFA).  His profile anchors on “accelerating the green mobility in Latam with investment and operation in Electric Vehicle (EV) and high speed charging network” and emphasizes prior experience at Stori and Capital One.  Functionally, he sits at the intersection of data science, risk modeling, growth marketing, and product, with a recent pivot into climate-tech and mobility infrastructure. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Seniority-wise, he has roughly a decade of progressively senior roles from Senior Data Analyst to Manager and Lead Data Scientist at Capital One and Stori, then Growth Marketing Director / Data Science and now Founder & CEO.  The profile shows repeated ownership of cross-functional teams (PM, engineering, BI, marketing), P&L-relevant models, and growth funnels, suggesting a late-stage IC / early executive profile transitioning into full founder responsibility.  Sector exposure is strong in LatAm fintech and US consumer banking, with an emerging but still thinly documented track record in EV/charging. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Headline strengths are: (1) clear, quantified impact in credit risk and growth (e.g., “driving over $30 million incremental in annual NPV”, “enabled 2X of monthly new customer booking growth in 3 months while improving the cost efficiency”), (2) hands-on leadership building data infrastructure and teams, and (3) elite technical/academic pedigree (dual master’s at Carnegie Mellon plus CFA Level III candidate) matched to applied roles.  Critical gaps include limited detail on LAFA’s traction, very sparse About section relative to his experience, and minimal visible thought leadership or content on LinkedIn. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Overall market positioning: he looks like a high-caliber, quantitatively strong operator and founder in LatAm fintech/green mobility rather than a pure-play research data scientist or pure growth marketer.  Against top-tier data-science and fintech founders, his experience is competitive on depth of applied risk and growth work but under-leverages narrative, branding, and public proof points for the current venture. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

## 2. Professional identity & differentiation

The headline repeats twice: “Passionate in accelerating the green mobility in Latam with investment and operation in Electric Vehicle (EV) and high speed charging network. Ex-Stori. Ex-Capital One.”  This is crisp about sector (green mobility in LatAm), mode (investment and operation), and credibility anchors (Stori, Capital One), but it underplays his data science and growth pedigree explicitly.  The About section, however, frames him as a “Well rounded data scientist in financial sector who had experience on model creation and implementation as well as building cloud data infrastructure for business reporting.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

The combination creates a somewhat split identity: headline as climate/EV founder, About as financial-sector data scientist.  There is no integrated statement that bridges his risk/growth background with the new EV business (e.g., using underwriting, asset risk and utilization analytics to derisk EV fleets). This means his unique value proposition—data-science-native founder building an EV infra company in LatAm—is implicit rather than explicitly articulated. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Distinctive traits that do emerge: repeated end-to-end ownership (from building ETL and cloud databases to leading cross-functional growth teams), and quantifiable impact in both US and LatAm contexts.  However, personal branding style on LinkedIn is conservative: very few lines of About, no narrative around LAFA’s mission/vision beyond “driving green mobility… by providing access to affordable electric vehicle and high speed charging facilities,” and limited activity beyond short congratulatory comments.  Value proposition clarity: medium—core domains and career story are discernible, but the explicit “why him” as a green-mobility founder is not fully spelled out.

### 3.2 Critical analysis of track record

Depth and relevance of experience are strong for data-driven consumer finance and increasingly relevant for EV/asset-backed models (credit, utilization, infrastructure).  He has built risk models, ETL/data infra, reporting, and led cross-functional growth efforts, which are all highly transferable to operating an EV fleet with underwriting, utilization, and unit economics constraints. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Progression trajectory is clearly upward: from Senior Data Analyst → Principal Data Analyst → Principal Data Scientist → Manager, Data Scientist at Capital One, then Lead Data Scientist and growth leadership roles at Stori, culminating in Founder/CEO of LAFA.  Tenures are generally 1–4 years with no obvious unexplained gaps; the one short stint (Manager, Data Scientist at Capital One for 8 months) is buffered by prior multi-year internal experience. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Verification of claims: the most concrete is “over $30 million incremental in annual NPV” from the new behavior risk model at Capital One and the “2X of monthly new customer booking growth in 3 months” at Stori, but both are self-reported without external validation.  Still, the specificity of these numbers and their alignment with plausible impact for such roles supports credibility more than vague “improved performance” statements. Impact scope spans from team-level (cross-functional squads) to business-line-level (deposit forecasts, US card acquisition, LatAm underwriting), but industry-level impact (e.g., publications, standards, ecosystem initiatives) is not visible. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Red flags and gaps: LAFA’s role description has zero traction metrics (no station count, partners, GMV, revenue, or financing), which is a significant omission for a founder profile.  Some role descriptions (e.g., Growth Marketing Director / Data Science) lack any narrative, which undercuts the story of his seniority and influence in that period.  There is mild role inflation risk in the current “Founder and CEO” title if LAFA were very early or pre-traction; however, he has prior co-founder history (SchemaFusion), which offsets concerns.

## 4. Skills benchmarking

### 4.1 Technical (hard) skills

Explicit skills listed are minimal: “credit risk modeling” and “Machine Learning,” with a “Show all” that is not visible in the captured content.  However, from experience descriptions we can infer technical domains: [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

- Credit risk modeling and valuation models (US Mainstreet, LatAm underwriting) [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Machine learning algorithms for risk and valuation [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Behavior risk models for new-to-credit US card acquisition [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Data engineering / infra: ETL pipelines, AWS Postgres SQL databases, vendor model scoring platform, bank deposit balance forecast data solutions [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Business reporting and sales performance reporting infrastructure [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Endorsement counts are not visible for “credit risk modeling” and “Machine Learning,” so social validation of skills cannot be quantified from the page snapshot. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### 4.2 Leadership & soft skills (with evidence)

Evidence-based soft/leadership skills:

- Cross-functional leadership: “Lead cross functional team including PM, Engineering, UI/UX, BI, data analyst and performance marketing specialist to archive hyper growth target.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Team building: “Lead and build the data science team that leverage machine learning technics and models to support key underwriting decision…” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Product ownership and agile: “Lead product development team for the web based solution as product owner and agile scrum master.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Client/partner communication: Principal Data Scientist role mentions “providing consultation for business partners on the model usage and business implication.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Recommendation: a client says “Roger was quick learner with great business sense and integrity. He has independent thinking and creative… one of the more competent Associate consultant that I have had the pleasure of work with him.” (Note: recommender calls him “Roger,” suggesting a former or alternative name.) [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### 4.3 Competency assessment vs. top-tier benchmark

- Technical depth in risk/ML: strong evidence of mastery-level practice in applied credit risk modeling and ML in high-stakes environments (Capital One US Card, Stori).  The $30M incremental NPV claim and multi-role progression suggest top decile competence in that niche. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Data infra and tooling: solid, but not necessarily elite specialist. He “Build entire data solution for bank deposit balance forecast model including data ETL pipeline across multiple platforms and creation of AWS Postgres SQL database” and helped implement a model scoring platform.  This reads as a strong full-stack analytics/ML engineer profile rather than deep infra engineer. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Growth and marketing: one standout claim (“enabled 2X of monthly new customer booking growth in 3 months while improving the cost efficiency”), but overall growth toolkit is not fully elaborated (no mention of experimentation frameworks, channel mix, LTV/CAC analytics, etc.). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Leadership/founder skills: history of co-founding SchemaFusion and now LAFA, plus cross-functional leadership and team-building.  However, there is no detail on fundraising, board management, or org-scale leadership. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Rating (holistic):

- Technical (risk/ML in consumer finance): Top 10% in sector based on roles and impact claims. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Data infra & reporting: Above Average to Top 25%—strong but not specialized. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Growth/marketing: Above Average—some strong outcomes, but sparse description. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Founder/CEO capability (as evidenced on LinkedIn): Above Average but unproven at scale—LAFA’s traction narrative is missing. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Overall competency tier from the profile alone: 🥈 **Above Average** (Top 10–25% in relevant sectors), with potential to be top-tier if LAFA’s traction and his growth playbook were better evidenced. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

***

## 5. Education & credentials

Education:

- Carnegie Mellon University: “Dual degree master, Civil Engineering & Technology Innovation Management, 2011 – 2013.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Tongji University: “Master, Construction Management, 2008 – 2011.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Credential:

- CFA Institute: “CFA Level III Candidate.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Additionally, a project “Innovation Evaluation for Phoebus Energy’s Hybrid Water Heating System” (Aug 2012 – Dec 2012, associated with CMU) shows exposure to energy/climate technologies early on: evaluating “technology, competitors, market and environmental impact as well as performed economic projections and analyses.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Benchmark vs top professionals: CMU with a dual degree in engineering and tech innovation is strongly competitive and in line with senior data/fintech leaders and founders.  The combination with a CFA track signals a rare mix of quantitative finance, engineering, and innovation management, which is an asset for both fintech and climate infra.  Lack of explicit academic honors (e.g., summa, dean’s list) is neutral rather than negative. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

***

## 6. Public activity & thought leadership

Activity highlights show “1,266 followers” and only two visible recent actions: short congratulatory comments (“Congrats Daniel! 🎉” from 7 months ago; “Congrats Juan !” from 10 months ago).  A “Show all” link for comments is present, but the captured content does not show original posts, articles, or longer insights. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

This pattern suggests low publishing frequency and minimal use of LinkedIn as a platform for sharing frameworks, learnings, or sector analysis. Topics in the visible feed are personal network congratulations rather than EV/fintech/growth content.  Engagement levels on those comments cannot be assessed from the snapshot. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Assessment:

- Presence vs expertise: the profile demonstrates expertise through work history rather than content; public activity reflects presence but not thought leadership. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Influence: no evidence of high-engagement posts, long-form articles, or being featured as a “Top Voice” or similar; interests include following Gerry Giacomán Colyer and others, but that is network consumption, not output. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Quality score: Low for public thought leadership on LinkedIn (as a channel), even though underlying expertise may be high. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

***

## 7. Network & social proof

Connections: “500+ connections” and “1,266 followers,” indicating a reasonably broad but not influencer-level network.  Mutuals listed include “Diego, Juan Pablo and 6 other mutual connections,” plus multiple founders and operators in LatAm fintech and tech among “People you may know” and “Interests” (e.g., CEO of Clara, Appio founder, etc.), which suggests a network embedded in relevant ecosystems. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Endorsements: only the skills list (“credit risk modeling,” “Machine Learning”) is visible, without endorsement counts or names, so endorsement quality and reciprocity patterns cannot be evaluated. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Recommendations: One recommendation from “david mawei, Simu4wisdom Consulting Co. - Designer,” dated August 22, 2011, describing him (as “Roger”) as “quick learner with great business sense and integrity,” “independent thinking and creative,” and “one of the more competent Associate consultant” the recommender has worked with.  While positive, it is old and not tied to his current sectors (fintech, EV). No recent recommendations are visible. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

External validations: The profile does not mention awards, publications, or speaking engagements.  The CFA Level III candidacy and CMU degrees are the main formal credentials. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Red flags: For a founder and senior data/growth leader, the absence of recent recommendations and visible high-signal endorsements is a mild concern but not uncommon in technical profiles.  Network strength is likely higher than LinkedIn artifacts suggest, given his employers (Capital One, Stori) and interests, but this is an inference rather than directly evidenced. (Speculative.)

## 10. Final verdict & ranking

### Tier classification

From LinkedIn evidence alone, he sits in: 🥈 **Above Average (Top 10–25%)** among professionals at the intersection of data science, risk, and fintech founders. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### Justification (3–5 points)

1. Multi-stage, progressive career at reputable institutions (Capital One, Stori) with clear upward trajectory into leadership and founder roles. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
2. Specific, high-impact quantitative claims (“over $30 million incremental in annual NPV,” “2X of monthly new customer booking growth in 3 months while improving the cost efficiency”). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
3. Strong educational and credential foundation (CMU dual master’s, Tongji master’s, CFA Level III candidate), aligned with his domains. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
4. Demonstrated cross-functional and team-building leadership across analytics, data science, and product/growth contexts. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
5. Emerging but under-documented founder track in green mobility (LAFA) with a clear mission but lacking traction evidence. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

- Unusual blend of civil/infra engineering, technology innovation management, and advanced data science applied to financial inclusion and now EV infrastructure. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Proven ability to both build foundational data infra (ETL, databases, scoring platforms) and drive measurable business outcomes via risk models and growth funnels. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Prior co-founder experience (SchemaFusion) and current role leading an EV/charging startup in Mexico City, giving him repeat-founder perspective. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### Gaps vs top tier

To reach a 🏆 Top 1–5% tier as visible on LinkedIn, the profile would need:

- Clear, quantified traction metrics and case studies for LAFA (customers, fleet size, station count, partners, revenue, unit economics). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Richer narrative and quantified impact for the senior Stori role and more explicit articulation of his growth strategy and playbooks. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Public thought leadership (posts, talks, articles) showcasing his frameworks on risk, growth, and green mobility, plus more recent recommendations from senior peers. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### Competitive context fit

He would excel in:

- Founder / co-founder roles in fintech, embedded finance, or green-mobility ventures where deep risk and growth analytics matter. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Head/Director of Data Science or Growth in consumer finance or mobility platforms, especially in LatAm or US-LatAm cross-border contexts. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

He may struggle—at least based on LinkedIn evidence—in:

- Roles requiring strong public-facing thought leadership or heavy investor-relations storytelling if he does not supplement with decks, metrics, or content. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Highly research-oriented ML labs or big-tech research roles, as his focus is applied, product and business oriented rather than academic. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### Key strengths (top 3)

1. Quantitative impact orientation: demonstrable business results from risk models and growth initiatives (e.g., $30M NPV, 2x bookings). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
2. Full-stack data and growth leadership: spanning ETL and infra, ML modeling, reporting, and cross-functional team leadership. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
3. Strong educational/credential base aligned with his domains, including CMU dual master’s and CFA Level III candidacy. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

### Critical gaps (top 3)

1. Lack of LAFA traction detail: makes it difficult to assess him as a founder/CEO for investment or senior partnership decisions. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
2. Underdeveloped narrative and branding: About and role descriptions do not fully communicate his unique value proposition or integrated story. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
3. Minimal recent social proof and thought leadership on LinkedIn: no recent recommendations, limited content, and no externally visible awards or publications. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

## Missing or uncertain information

- LAFA’s operational and financial metrics, team size, funding status, and partner ecosystem are absent, which significantly constrains evaluation of his current effectiveness as a founder. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- Endorsement counts and the full skills list are not visible, so we cannot accurately weigh which skills the network most recognizes. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- The profile snapshot does not surface his own posts or articles, only two brief comments; he may have more content that is not visible in this capture. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)
- The “Roger” vs “Jianan” naming in the recommendation is ambiguous and could be clarified to avoid confusion. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

Where evaluation depends on these missing elements—especially LAFA performance—any investment or partnership decision should be supplemented with direct conversations, deck review, and potentially references from Stori and Capital One stakeholders. (Speculative conclusion based on standard diligence practice.) [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianan-jiang-4b37b031/)

## Evaluacion de Fit para LAFA

The LinkedIn audit above evaluates JJ as a professional. This section evaluates whether his specific capabilities match what LAFA needs from its CEO in the next 12-18 months.

### Can he raise capital?

**Assessment: PROBABLE YES, but unproven at LAFA.**

LAFA needs significant capital to go from 150 to 2,000 vehicles (~MXN $800M in assets). JJ has:
- CMU pedigree + CFA Level III candidacy = credibility with financial investors
- Capital One + Stori background = legible story for fintech/LatAm VCs
- US-based presence (LAFA Inc in McLean, VA) = access to US capital markets

**Gap:** No visible fundraising track record. SchemaFusion (first startup) has no disclosed funding. LAFA has no Crunchbase/PitchBook profile. The competitive set (VEMO $500M+, OCN $100M+) has already raised — if JJ hasn't raised yet, the question is: can he raise fast enough to match the growth plan?

**What to probe in interview:** "What's the current funding status? Is there a term sheet or LOI? What's the runway at current burn?"

### Can he negotiate with Chinese OEMs?

**Assessment: STRONG YES — this appears to be his primary value-add.**

JJ is Chinese (Qingdao U of Tech + Tongji University). He "works directly with China" on OEM partnerships (confirmed by Levi). The Geely, JAC, and GAC partnerships are likely his direct relationships. In a market where Chinese OEM access = supply access, this is a rare and defensible advantage that VEMO and OCN cannot easily replicate.

**Gap:** The Geely intelligence gap suggests that even JJ's OEM relationships may not be fully operationalized. If he can't answer "does Geely have local assembly?" quickly, the relationship may be newer or less deep than assumed.

### Does he understand tech enough to not block the team?

**Assessment: YES — above average for a non-technical CEO.**

JJ built ETL pipelines, AWS databases, ML risk models, and scoring platforms at Capital One and Stori. He is not a software engineer, but he understands data infrastructure, model deployment, and technical decision-making at a level that should prevent the most common CEO anti-pattern (demanding impossible timelines or architecturally unsound features).

**Risk:** He's been a CEO/founder for 15 months and hasn't built a tech team yet. This could mean: (a) tech wasn't prioritized while commercial ops launched, or (b) difficulty attracting technical talent. Either way, the AI Product Engineer hire is overdue.

### Overall Fit Verdict

JJ is well-suited for LAFA's CEO role **if** he can close a funding round in the next 6 months. His OEM access is the company's core asset, his risk/data background provides strategic intelligence for a fintech-fleet hybrid, and his CMU/CFA credentials are fundable. The main risk is execution speed: the growth plan (150 → 2,000 in 12 months) requires capital, tech infrastructure, and operational scaling simultaneously, and he's running this remotely from China/US with a 3-month-old Head of Product who is part-time.

**What matters most in the JJ interview:**
1. Funding status and runway (existential question)
2. Geely assembly/tariff status (biggest cost uncertainty)
3. His view on tech hiring pace and budget (determines Jose's working conditions)
4. How he makes decisions remotely during a 13x scaling phase
