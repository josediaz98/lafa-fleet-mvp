> *Detailed profile. Executive summary: [thesis/07-team.md](../thesis/07-team.md)*

David Arturo Ulloa Berumen's LinkedIn reads as an early-career **customer support** professional with one clear upward move into supervision, but the profile currently lacks the impact proof (metrics, scoped outcomes, recommendations, rich “About”) that top-tier candidates use to signal credibility fast. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

## 1) Executive summary
**Identity & differentiation:** The profile positions David as a customer service operator in Mexico City, currently at LAFA, with prior multi-year experience at MI NAVE.  Differentiation is not clearly articulated because the captured profile view does not show an “About” narrative or a value proposition statement—only role/education snippets and basic sections. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Sector & seniority:** Based on titles (“Servicio de atención al cliente” → “Supervisor de atención al cliente”), the trajectory suggests frontline support → first-line people/process supervision (entry-level to junior-mid).  Tenure at MI NAVE (~4 years) is a positive stability signal, and the move to a supervisor role in Oct 2025 indicates progression. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Strengths vs gaps:** Strengths are role continuity in customer-facing work and a visible promotion step.  Critical gaps are (a) no quantified outcomes in experience descriptions, (b) minimal skills footprint (only two skills shown), and (c) limited public proof (low network size, minimal visible activity variety). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Market positioning:** Against LinkedIn’s own guidance that strong summaries/experience should emphasize achievements with numbers (proof), this profile currently signals “present but not optimized,” which may underperform in competitive hiring funnels even if on-the-job performance is strong.

## 2) Professional identity & track record
**Value prop clarity (About):** In the captured page content, an “About” section text is not present to quote—so the value proposition is effectively **absent or not observable** in this view.  That makes it hard to answer: “What problem do you solve, for whom, and with what evidence?”—the core question strong LinkedIn summaries are expected to address. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own)

### Career chronology (evidence table)
| Company | Role | Period | Key achievements (as written) | Evidence quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LAFA | “Supervisor de atención al cliente” | “Oct 2025 - Present · 5 mos” | No measurable outcomes or scope shown in the captured experience entry.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | Low (title + dates only).  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) |
| MI NAVE | “Servicio de atención al cliente” | “Sep 2021 - Oct 2025 · 4 yrs 2 mos” | No measurable outcomes or scope shown in the captured experience entry.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | Low (title + dates only).  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) |

### Critical analysis (what’s provable vs not)
- **Progression:** There is a clear upward move from “Servicio de atención al cliente” to “Supervisor de atención al cliente,” which is consistent with a promotion or step-up in responsibility. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- **Impact verification:** No revenue, SLA, CSAT, retention, AHT, productivity, or cost metrics are visible in experience—so impact cannot be verified from the profile as captured. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- **Red-flag scan:** No obvious short-tenure pattern appears (one ~4-year stint, one current role).  The main risk is “role ambiguity” (title without scope: team size, channels handled, KPIs owned, tools used). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

## 3) Skills benchmarking (vs top-tier profiles)
**Visible skills (no endorsement counts shown):** The profile shows “Servicio de atención al cliente” and “Liderazgo.”  Endorsement counts are not visible in the captured view, so skills depth can’t be validated via social proof here. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Competency assessment (evidence-based):**
- Top-tier LinkedIn profiles typically make claims legible through quantified achievements and concrete outcomes in summary/experience; LinkedIn’s own examples and guidance emphasize including numbers (“proof”) to quantify achievements. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own)
- This profile provides titles/dates but not “results,” so demonstrated mastery is not evidenced on-page. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- **Rating (profile evidence, not person): Average to Below Average** for competitiveness in hiring screens, because the observable content under-delivers on the “show impact” standard that LinkedIn itself promotes. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own)

Actionable benchmark target (customer support/supervision): add 3–6 bullets per role with measurable artifacts (e.g., CSAT/NPS uplift, ticket backlog reduction, FCR improvement, AHT reduction, QA scores, escalation rate drop, schedule adherence, training throughput), aligning to “quantify achievements” expectations. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own)

## 4) Education, activity, and social proof
**Education:** The profile lists “Instituto Politécnico Nacional” and a program in “Relaciones Comerciales, Relaciones públicas, publicidad y comunicación aplicada” with dates “2016 – 2020.”  No certifications or specialized training are visible in the captured view. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Public activity & thought leadership (observable):** The Activity section shows “reposted this” and includes a repost of an Excel-related post (“Top 100 Excel Hacks”) from “Nicolas Boucher Online.”  The post displayed shows high engagement numbers (e.g., “3,256 reactions”), but the page does not clearly attribute that engagement to David’s repost versus the original post, so influence can’t be confidently inferred. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

**Network & social proof:** The profile shows “31 connections” and “31 followers.”  A Recommendations section is not visible in the captured view; LinkedIn Help notes the Recommendations section only displays once you give or receive a recommendation that isn’t hidden.

## 5) Gap analysis, red flags, keywords, verdict
### Risk assessment table
| Type | Description | Evidence | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gap | No visible “About” narrative/value proposition to explain scope, strengths, or target roles. | “About” text not present in captured view.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | High |
| Gap | No quantified achievements (KPIs, scope, tools) in experience entries. | Experience entries show titles/dates only.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | High |
| Gap | Thin skills footprint (only two skills visible), no endorsement counts visible. | Skills show “Servicio de atención al cliente” and “Liderazgo.”  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | Medium |
| Ambiguity | True impact and seniority scope (team size, channels, KPIs owned) unclear. | Titles don’t include scope details.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | High |
| Red flag (soft) | Low network size for signaling/visibility (may be fine personally, but weaker for discoverability). | “31 connections,” “31 followers.”  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | Medium |
| Ambiguity | Thought leadership/influence unclear due to repost vs original engagement attribution. | Activity shows a repost with engagement figures shown on the post view.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/) | Medium |

### Keyword mapping (from the profile)
- Technical skills: Excel (implied via repost topic only). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- Industries: Customer service / customer support (explicit), likely consumer ops (inferred only from titles, so keep generic). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- Methodologies: Not stated. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- Interests: LAFA, Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V. (shown under Interests/Companies). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
- Themes: Customer service, leadership, supervision, commercial relations/communications education. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)

### Final verdict & ranking (profile quality)
**Tier: ⚠️ Below Average (for LinkedIn competitiveness)**—because the profile currently lacks the two biggest differentiators LinkedIn itself spotlights: a strong summary with proof/metrics and experience entries that showcase achievements with numbers. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own)

**3 evidence points**
1. Experience entries show roles and dates but no outcomes/KPIs. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
2. “About” text is not visible in the captured view, so differentiation is not communicated. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arturo-ulloa-berumen-91a297210/)
3. Social proof and discoverability signals are thin (31 connections, limited visible skills, no visible recommendations section). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a546682)

If you want, I can draft a high-performing “About” (Spanish or English) and rewrite both roles into quantified bullets—but I’ll need 5–10 concrete metrics (CSAT, volume, channels, team size, tooling, and 2–3 wins per role).
