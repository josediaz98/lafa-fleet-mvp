> *Detailed profile. Executive summary: [thesis/07-team.md](../thesis/07-team.md)*

Víctor Daniel Briones positions himself as a revenue-and-operations builder for fintech/mobility in LatAm, with a track record framed around scaling teams, launching markets, and building GTM engines.  His profile reads like a “commercial + ops + CX” executive who has operated at director/VP/country-manager scope, with multiple quantified outcomes but uneven third‑party verifiability inside LinkedIn itself. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

## 1) Executive summary
His core identity is explicit: “I build fast-moving teams that solve real problems, grow revenue, and scale what works,” anchored in fintech, mobility, and aviation across Latin America.  Seniority signals are strong (current “Sales & Customer Experience Director @LAFA,” prior “Commercial and Customer Service Director,” “Country Manager,” “Sales VP”) and he claims experience through Series A/B contexts and market launches. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Headline strengths: repeated quantified outcomes (e.g., “Scaled userbase from 27K to 3M,” “revenue 31x,” “cut costs by 71%,” “cut marketing acquisition costs by 27%,” “improved lead-to-car conversion by 67%”) and clear scope statements (P&L ownership, team sizes, direct reports).  Critical gaps: some short tenures, a visible timeline gap (Jun 2023 → Feb 2024), limited skills/endorsement visibility in the captured data, and at least one credential entry that appears internally inconsistent (TOEFL “iBT” with a “667” score marked “Perfect score”). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Market positioning: strong fit for growth-stage LatAm operators in fintech/mobility needing GTM rebuilds, pricing/segmentation, onboarding/retention, and partner ecosystems.  The profile is closer to “operator-executive” than “thought leader,” based on the activity sample (practical leadership/career lessons, moderate engagement). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

## 2) Identity & differentiation
The value proposition is clear and directly stated, with specific domains and operating style: “speed, focus, and data at the core,” plus culture-building (“empower people to move fast, take ownership”).  Differentiation vs many peers is the consistent blend of commercial leadership with customer ops/CX/process design (e.g., LAFA LTO onboarding/support/ops, Mi Nave onboarding + CS + engagement, Destácame product suite expansion + partnerships). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Branding style: assertive, operator-led, metric-forward, and cross-functional; the “About” section compresses 15 years into a single narrative of “zero to millions” + “rebuilt go-to-market engines” + “Series A and B.”  The risk is mild “generic excellence” phrasing (“solve real problems,” “scale what works”) without naming flagship outcomes by company in the “About” itself—those details mostly live in Experience bullets.

## 3) Track record & impact evidence
Below is the extracted chronology; “Evidence quality” here means: **High** = quantified + scoped + tied to role; **Medium** = scoped but not quantified or not attributable; **Low** = generic/aspirational. (This is an analytic rating, not a fact.)

Critical analysis (evidence-based):
- Progression trajectory is broadly upward: intern/analyst → product manager → VP Sales → Country Manager (P&L) → director-level commercial/CX roles. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- The profile includes multiple “hard metrics,” but most are self-reported in Experience bullets; external validation is hinted via linked articles/thumbnails (e.g., Bloomberg Línea/Excélsior thumbnails inside Destácame entries) without the underlying sources being shown in the captured content. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Potential red flags: short stints (e.g., Expertis Partners 6 months; MI NAVE director role 5 months) and an unexplained gap between Jun 2023 and Feb 2024. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

## 4) Skills, education, social proof
Skills (captured/visible):
- Top skills shown: “Team Leadership,” “Operational Strategy,” “Go-to-Market Strategy,” “Data-driven Decision Making,” “Growth Strategies.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Endorsement visibility is limited in the captured view; “Growth Strategies” shows “1 endorsement,” and “Financial Analysis” shows “1 endorsement.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Competency benchmarking (analytic judgment):
- Demonstrated mastery signals (above-average to top-10%-ish) are strongest in GTM execution, pricing/segmentation, and scaling ops (dynamic pricing engine, CAC reduction, conversion lift, large-scale user/revenue/team scaling). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- The main gap versus “top-tier/Top 1%” LinkedIn operators is *proof density*: more third-party artifacts (press links opened/quoted, portfolio case studies, talks), more recommendations from senior peers, and more visible endorsements across a broader skill set would materially strengthen credibility.

Education & credentials:
- MBA: Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), Oct 2015 – Dec 2016; notes “Highest GPA (9.6) of Full-time MBA class of 2016.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Bachelor’s: Tecnológico de Monterrey, Economics, Jul 2006 – Dec 2010; “Elected president of Economics alumni association - 2007/2008.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Test score entry: “Toefl iBT… Score: 667… Perfect score” (this line is internally inconsistent as written and should be clarified). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Social proof:
- Network: “2,012 followers” and “500+ connections.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Recommendations received: two visible, both from direct reports, emphasizing leadership, strategic decision-making, innovation, and people development. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Honors: Destácame Mexico “Corporate values representative 2021: Collaboration” and “2022: Get It Done.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

## 5) Activity, gaps, keywords, verdict
Public activity (posts + comments captured):
- Posting topics skew to leadership/culture (“El descanso… es estrategia”), commercial execution levers (pipeline/forecast discipline), market expansion pitfalls, retention vs growth (“Crecimiento real = ingresos - churn”), and career decision-making; sample posts show modest engagement (e.g., 29 reactions/5 comments; 49 reactions/8 comments). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Comment style is supportive and low-ego (“Felicidades!!!!”, “Que grande…!!!!!”) and he responds calmly to criticism (“Hola Luis, gracias por comentar! … Un abrazo…”). 

Thought leadership quality (analytic judgment): Medium—content is practical and experience-coded, but mostly generalizable lessons rather than original frameworks backed by unique data or repeatable artifacts. 

Risk / gap assessment (from captured data):

| Type | Description | Evidence | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gap | Limited visibility into full skills/endorsement distribution in captured data (makes benchmarking harder). | Skills detail page didn’t expose the list; only top skills + two 1-endorsement entries are visible.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/) | Medium |
| Gap | Unexplained timeline gap (Jun 2023 → Feb 2024). | Destácame ends Jun 2023; MI NAVE starts Feb 2024.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/) | Medium |
| Red Flag | Short tenures could invite “why?” questions (not necessarily negative). | Expertis Partners 6 mos; MI NAVE director role 5 mos.  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/) | Low–Medium |
| Ambiguity | TOEFL entry appears inconsistent (format/scale mismatch). | “Toefl iBT… Score: 667… Perfect score.”  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/) | Medium |

Keyword mapping (extracted from headline/about/experience/projects):
- Technical skills: Dynamic pricing, CRM, segmentation, forecasting/pipeline discipline, onboarding ops, retention/churn, P&L management, structured finance/risk modeling (exposure). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Industries: Fintech, mobility/EV leasing, aviation, ride-hailing/last-mile delivery. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Methodologies/themes: Go-to-market, growth strategy, data-driven decision making, cross-functional leadership, partnerships/BD, market expansion. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- Interests (visible): LAFA; Luca (company follow). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Final verdict & ranking:
- Tier classification: 🥈 **Above Average (Top 10–25%)** for LatAm fintech/mobility commercial operators, driven by repeated quantified outcomes and P&L/team leadership scope. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)
- What blocks 🏆 Top Tier in a hiring/partner/investor read: more externally verifiable artifacts (opened/quoted press, case studies), clearer explanation of transitions/gaps, and cleaning up credential inconsistencies (TOEFL entry). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdbriones/)

Missing or uncertain information (material):
- Full skills list + endorsement counts weren’t accessible in the captured Skills detail view, so the skills benchmark is incomplete. 
- Only a slice of posts/comments is captured (“Loaded 20 Posts,” “Loaded 19 Comments”), so activity frequency over longer horizons can’t be asserted from this snapshot.
