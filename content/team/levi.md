## 1. Executive summary

Levi García is a **product** leader in Mexican fintech and mobility with a strong transactional/payments backbone and a current tilt toward AI orchestration and EV-enabled mobility. His headline (“Product | AI Orchestrator | ex-CLIP | ex-Stori”) positions him squarely at the intersection of core payments infrastructure, consumer credit, and applied AI for real-world services. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) This combination is differentiated in LatAm, where few PMs have owned both credit-card lifecycle at scale and acquirer/routing economics, then moved into 0→1 AI-native products.

Sector-wise he is clearly fintech (payments, credit cards) with an emerging bet on mobility/EV, operating at Group Product Manager / Head of Product level in scaled fintechs (Clip, Stori) and as Senior PM / AI Orchestrator in an early-stage mobility startup (LAFA). His primary expertise is in transaction rails (acquiring, routing, settlement, pricing), card products, and go-to-market/ops for POS and loyalty/payments solutions, with solid earlier grounding in hardware and mechatronics. The About section frames him as “Engineer by formation and a big enthusiast of building digital solutions with purpose. A true believer in innovation that can help dissolve social inequity,” which reinforces a socially driven narrative but remains high level in terms of product craft and outcomes. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Headline strengths include: (1) proven impact on unit economics and infrastructure (e.g., routing-engine cost savings of 100k USD/month and a DCC product generating 2M USD in 2 months at Clip), (2) end-to-end card product launches and scale to 1M customers at Stori, and (3) repeated leadership responsibility over critical transactional cores and payment channels. Market-wise, this puts him in the top decile of LatAm fintech product managers by ownership scope and demonstrated impact, though not in the global “brand-name PM” tier (no FAANG / Tier‑1 global fintech logos, no public thought-leadership footprint). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Critical gaps for a top-1% benchmark: the profile is thin on how he operates (product methodologies, experimentation, PM frameworks, data stack), on AI depth beyond high-level narrative, and on leadership systems (org design, hiring, coaching, portfolio management). The About and Skills sections are underdeveloped (only “Agile” and “Problem Solving” listed as skills; no explicit AI, data, or payments stack skills), which underrepresents his actual experience and makes his “AI Orchestrator” positioning feel more narrative than evidenced. Overall, he looks like a strong, execution-heavy Group PM / Head of Product for LatAm fintech and a credible early lead for AI-infused transactional products, but not yet a visible thought leader or CPO-level operator. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

## 2. Professional identity & differentiation

The About section is short: “Engineer by formation and a big enthusiast of building digital solutions with purpose. A true believer in innovation that can help dissolve social inequity.” This conveys values (purpose, social inequity) and engineering roots but does not articulate a concrete product value proposition, specialties, or signature outcomes. As a result, the value prop is **vague**: it signals motivation but not a crisp promise like “I design and scale transaction platforms that improve approval rates and unit economics for high-growth fintechs.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Differentiation comes more from the Experience section than from explicit branding. At Clip, he “oversee[s] the Clip Transactional Core, responsible for the entire transaction lifecycle, from reception and PCI compliance to routing, authorization, and settlement,” and he ties this to specific optimizations in acquirer routing, customer balances, pricing, debt control, and funds distribution. At Stori, he progressed from Product Manager to Product Manager Leader to Head of Product, leading squads such as Delivery, Transactional Core, Payment Channels, and Customer Service and reaching “a significant milestone of acquiring 1 million customers.” This pattern—owning transaction cores at two well-known LatAm fintechs—is distinctive regionally. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Positioning strategy in the headline (“Product | AI Orchestrator | ex-CLIP | ex-Stori”) leans on brand signaling and an emerging AI angle. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) LAFA’s description reinforces the AI narrative: “We are rebuilding the mobility experience in Mexico… By combining an AI-driven backend with a 100% EV fleet…” and emphasizes themes like “Sustainability,” “Social Mobility,” and “Tech Excellence.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) However, the profile does not detail concrete AI systems, models, or orchestration patterns he has shipped, so “AI Orchestrator” is not yet backed by explicit evidence; it reads more as aspirational positioning anchored in a new role than as a demonstrated specialization.

## 3. Track record & impact evidence

### 3.1 Career chronology table

| Company | Role | Period | Key achievements (from profile) | Evidence quality |
|--------|------|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| LAFA | Senior Product Manager / AI Orchestrator (Part-time) | Nov 2025 – Present (4 months) | “We are rebuilding the mobility experience in Mexico from the ground up.

Early-stage, low verifiability. |
| Clip | Group Product Manager | Feb 2023 – May 2025 (2 yrs 4 mos), Mexico City, remote | Responsibilities: “Overseeing the Clip Transactional Core… entire transaction lifecycle… from reception and PCI compliance to routing, authorization, and settlement.” “Key responsibilities included optimizing acquirer routing… managing customer balances… overseeing pricing, debt control, and funds distribution.” Achievements: integrated two new acquirers, enabled connectivity to “the two primary clearing houses in Mexico”; “Revamped the routing engine… resulting in monthly cost savings of 100,000 USD”; launched “in-house solution for international dynamic currency (USD) transactions, generating 2 million USD in revenue within the first 2 months”; implemented new payment methods (QPS: +5% approval for transactions <250 MXN; SPEI for interbank transfers; USD payments for international sales). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Strong: multiple concrete financial and performance metrics; clear scope of responsibility; plausible for role; partially externally verifiable via Clip’s business model but not directly cross-checked here. |
| Stori | Head of Product | Jan 2022 – Feb 2023 (1 yr 2 mos) | “Led the product team at Stori… aligning team efforts to optimize operational efficiency.” Oversaw squads: “Delivery, Transactional Core, Payment Channels, and Customer Service.” “Defined and executed quarterly OKRs for cross-functional teams.” States that “we achieved a significant milestone of acquiring 1 million customers” during his tenure. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium: clear leadership scope and org context; milestone (1M customers) is plausible and broadly known in the market, but attribution to him is not quantified (no uplift percentages or before/after). |
| Stori | Product Manager Leader | Jul 2020 – Dec 2021 (1 yr 6 mos) | “Led a product team to successfully launch a new credit card product from inception to market.” Achievements: developed and launched customized credit card products for diverse segments; integrated SPEI real-time payment capabilities; implemented automation tools for collections to improve delinquency rates. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium: describes PM responsibilities and outputs; uses generic impact language (“improve delinquency rates”) without numbers; SPEI integration is concrete but not quantified. |
| Stori | Product Manager | Feb 2019 – Jun 2020 (1 yr 5 mos) | “Led the coordination of vendor integrations, backend services, and processes to launch a new credit card product within an 8-month timeframe.” Covered KYC, registration, card delivery, activation, and transaction processing. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium: clear scope and timeline (8 months); no performance metrics (conversion, activation rates, card usage). |
| Virtual Market (VM) | Head of New Projects | Jan 2017 – Jan 2019 (2 yrs 1 mo), CDMX | “In charge of develop and deploy new products and projects…” Achievements: (1) led development of a custom POS app for AB InBev’s Modelorama chain, achieving “80% adoption rate”; (2) deployed British American Tobacco loyalty program with “800 users in 2018”; (3) evaluated and integrated EMV reader into VM app, increasing average ticket amount “+383% (Modelorama)”; (4) “Developed the Product Management area and processes.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium‑strong for pre‑fintech stage: specific clients, adoption rate, and ticket uplift metric; sample sizes and timeframes not detailed. |
| Virtual Market (VM) | Innovation Engineer | Mar 2015 – Dec 2016 (1 yr 10 mos) | Led development of “new generation POS terminal” (interface, electronics, case design, injection molds, suppliers). Led POS device productivity project reaching “-30% savings,” including testing alternate POS devices/peripherals, ensuring compliance with NOMs, and adding merchant value via “all-in-one” mobility/space reduction and stock registration simplicity. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium: clear engineering scope and -30% cost savings claim; lacks financial baseline and timeframe. |
| Mercado Machinery | Robotic Welding Responsible | 2012 – 2014 (2 yrs) | Responsible for evaluating welding applications to automate, selecting robotic units and power sources, designing robotic cells (workstations, fixtures, areas, safety), supervising installation and electric connections, programming robots, and teaching basic programming courses to client personnel. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium: responsibilities well-described; no metrics (throughput, defect rates, cost reduction). |

### 3.2 Critical analysis of track record

Depth and relevance: For a fintech/AI product benchmark, his most relevant experience is Clip and Stori. At Clip he owns mission-critical transactional core components and delivers concrete financial impact (100k USD per month cost savings, 2M USD incremental revenue in 2 months, +5% approval rate in a specific transaction band), which is consistent with a strong Group Product Manager owning P&L-relevant infrastructure. At Stori he shows stepwise progression (PM → PM Leader → Head of Product) and responsibility for multiple squads involved in the credit card lifecycle and transaction processing. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Trajectory: The progression is clearly upward: technical/mechanical roles in robotic welding → POS hardware/innovation → head of new projects in a retail-tech context → PM roles in a high-growth credit-card fintech → head of product → GPM at a scaled payments company → Senior PM / AI Orchestrator at an early-stage mobility startup. The move from Head of Product at Stori to Group PM at Clip could look lateral or even slightly downward in title but is likely an upward move in company scale and scope; the profile does not explicitly frame this, which leaves room for superficial misinterpretation. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Verification and scope: Claims at Clip and Virtual Market are metric-heavy and specific (100k/month, 2M in 2 months, +5% approvals, +383% average ticket, -30% savings), which is a positive signal for impact orientation but not externally verifiable from the profile alone. The profile does not provide external artifacts (case studies, talks, posts) that corroborate these impacts, though a recommendation from a Clip director notes he has “gran orientación a resultados y una capacidad analítica para entender tanto a clientes como situaciones o problemáticas” and “excelentes soft skills para lograr proyectos y crear una dinámica de equipo,” which aligns qualitatively. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Red flags and gaps:

- Vague claims: Several statements use generic improvement language without numbers (“improve delinquency rates,” “optimize operational efficiency,” “highly satisfactory product experience”), especially in Stori roles and LAFA. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Short tenures: The Head of Product stint at Stori is about 1 year 2 months, followed by ~2 years 4 months at Clip and then a part-time role at LAFA. Nothing obviously alarming for startup/fintech norms, but no explanations are given. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Role inflation: The titles are consistent with responsibilities; “Head of Product” at Stori and “Group Product Manager” at Clip are aligned with leading multiple squads and transactional core; “AI Orchestrator” is more ambiguous because AI responsibilities are not specified.
- Timeline gaps: Education ends in 2011; work starts 2012 and flows continuously through to present with no evident gaps. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Impact scope appears substantial at company level for Clip and Stori (core transaction infrastructure, 1M customers milestone) and at key-client level for Virtual Market (Modelorama, BAT). There is no evidence of industry-level influence (standards, open-source, widely cited thought leadership) in the profile itself. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

***

## 4. Skills benchmarking

### 4.1 Technical skills (as stated)

The Skills section explicitly lists only:

- “Agile” (with an option to “Endorse”). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- “Problem Solving.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

No endorsement counts are visible in the captured content, and there are no explicit skills for payments, product management, AI, data, or specific technologies. From experience descriptions, we can infer unstated technical competencies:

- Payments/Fintech: acquirer routing, PCI compliance, clearing-house connectivity, SPEI integration, credit card transaction lifecycle, debt control, funds distribution. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Product/Technical delivery: new POS hardware design, EMV integration, KYC and registration flows, card delivery/activation, backend vendor integration, routing engine redesign. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Data/Optimization: cost-savings and revenue-boost projects, approval rate improvements, delinquency-focused automation, though no analytics tools or languages are named. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

However, under your requested rigor, any unstated skill remains an inference, not a declared skill.

### 4.2 Leadership & soft skills (with evidence)

Soft skills evidenced:

- Team leadership: “Led the product team at Stori,” “Led a product team to successfully launch a new credit card product,” “Developed the Product Management area and processes” at Virtual Market. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder alignment: Responsibilities spanning vendors, backend services, operations, and customer service squads imply high cross-functional coordination. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Analytical and result-orientation: The recommendation from Clip’s Large & Middle Market Director describes him as “muy comprometido, con gran orientación a resultados y una capacidad analítica para entender tanto a clientes como situaciones o problemáticas.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Reliability and teamwork: Another recommendation notes he is “a great team player, highly reliable and committed, as well as, hard working and loyal.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

These are qualitatively validated by recommendations and by the nature of his roles. Still, the profile does not explicitly describe his leadership philosophy, feedback culture, or hiring/coaching track record.

### 4.3 Competency assessment vs top-tier benchmark

Benchmarks: compare to top-tier LatAm fintech product leaders (e.g., Heads/Directors of Product at Nubank, Mercado Pago, Clip/Stori peers, Revolut LatAm leadership) and top 1% global PMs (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, Cash App, Wise).

- Evidence of mastery:
  - Transactional core and routing economics: The Clip description shows ownership of transaction lifecycle and concrete optimizations in routing, clearing-house connectivity, and currency products, with tangible financial outcomes (100k USD/month savings, 2M USD revenue in 2 months). This is consistent with high competence in payment infrastructure product management. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
  - 0→1 and 1→N card product launches: At Stori and Virtual Market, he leads from inception to launch across vendor integrations, KYC, and POS/loyalty products with adoption metrics. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Areas likely at basic/medium proficiency (from profile only):
  - AI: “AI Orchestrator” and LAFA’s “AI-driven backend” language are not matched with details on models, orchestration frameworks, or experimentation methods. This suggests emerging involvement rather than deep technical AI product mastery. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
  - Product methodology and experimentation: No explicit mention of A/B testing, discovery frameworks (e.g., JTBD, opportunity solution trees), or product analytics tools; any competence here is implicit.
  - Public communication and thought leadership: Activity is largely job-sharing and reposts; no original long-form product/fintech content. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Rating (strict, evidence-based):

- Technical product skills (payments/transactions): Top 10% in LatAm fintech PMs, possibly higher regionally but not enough data to assert top 1%. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Leadership (team-level): Above Average to Top 10–25%; he has led multiple squads and held Head of Product and Group PM roles, but lacks public demonstrations of org-level product strategy or scaling beyond 1–2 teams. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- AI product skills: Currently Average to Above Average based on profile; title suggests ambition but proof points are not yet visible. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Overall: 🥈 **Above Average** (Top 10–25%) within LatAm fintech product talent pool; below the global “elite” tier due to missing specialization depth signals and public footprint.

***

## 5. Education & credentials

Education:

- Instituto Politécnico Nacional – “Mechatronic Engineerring, Engineering Design,” 2004–2011; activities: SAE. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingeniería y Tecnologías Avanzadas – “Ingenieria en Mecatronica, Mecatronica” (no dates given in capture, but likely overlapping/linked). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Licenses & certifications (both 2012–2013, welding/robotics):

- “SMAW / GMAW / FCAW / GTAW Welding Course,” issued Nov 2012, expires Nov 2012. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- “OTC Daihen / Nachi Robot Programming Course,” issued Jan 2013, expires Jan 2013, from OTC DAIHEN, Inc. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Benchmark: In LatAm fintech product leadership, a mechatronics engineering background from IPN is solid but not elite in the global sense (vs. top-ranked global CS/Math programs or MBAs from top business schools). However, for transactional and hardware-adjacent fintech, this grounding in systems, electronics, and robotics is advantageous and consistent with his POS and routing work. There are no recent credentials in product management, data science, or AI, which creates a perceived gap versus top-tier AI/fintech PMs who often show ongoing education in ML, experimentation, or advanced analytics. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

***

## 6. Public activity & thought leadership

From the Activity section, he has “1,044 followers.” Recent activity includes: [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

- Original posts recruiting for an “AI Product Engineer” at LAFA and for roles at Clip (Data Analyst for Product) and promoting Kira’s launch, expressing pride in contributing to impactful solutions. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Reposts of job posts and ecosystem content: Senior Product Manager roles at Clip, Business Analytics roles at Stori, Stori product lead posting, and José Díaz García’s fintech/neobank analyses and Kira funding announcement. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- A reflective post when leaving Clip after 27 months, thanking colleagues and describing learning about payments and SMB impact. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Engagement is decent for LatAm PM standards: e.g., 17 reactions and 2 reposts on a LAFA hiring post, 27 reactions and 6 reposts on a Clip job post he shares, 139 reactions and 10 comments on his farewell message, and higher engagement on reposted high-signal ecosystem content (e.g., 97+ reactions, 8 comments, 17 reposts on a Stori hiring post he amplified). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Assessment:

- Post frequency: roughly every 2–4 months with visible posts across 6–12 months, mostly around hiring, company milestones, and ecosystem news. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Original insight level: low; posts are mostly short, descriptive, and non-technical, emphasizing pride, opportunity, and mission rather than detailed product or AI insights. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Authority demonstration: implicit (role and company contexts, topics) rather than explicit (no threads on routing optimization, credit risk, experimentation, or AI orchestration). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Quality score: **Medium–Low** as thought leadership (little original content), **Medium** as professional presence (active, supportive of ecosystem, signals seniority). There is no evidence of influence beyond his immediate network and companies; no public debates, contrarian takes, or deep technical writeups.

***

## 7. Network & social proof

Network: The profile shows at least a few mutual connections (e.g., “Madhu,” “Grecia,” and one other mutual connection) and 1,044 followers, which is modest but normal for a senior PM not actively building a public persona. Interests include companies like LAFA and GatekeeperX, and people suggestions include product leaders at Clip, Revolut, etc., which indicates a network centered on fintech and mobility. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Endorsements: Only the skills “Agile” and “Problem Solving” appear, with no visible endorsement counts in the capture. This is a missed opportunity for social proof on product, payments, and AI. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

Recommendations (Received):

- From Mehdi Saidi, Large & Middle Market Director at Clip, who worked with him on the same team: highlights him as “muy comprometido,” with strong results orientation, analytical ability to understand “clientes” and “situaciones o problemáticas,” and “excelentes soft skills” to drive projects and create a good team dynamic. This is a credible senior commercial leader endorsing his product and soft skills. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- From Carmen Lira, senior marketer, who worked with him from different companies: describes him as “a great team player, highly reliable and committed, as well as, hard working and loyal,” and expresses confidence he will “succeed in any professional challenge.” [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

External validations:

- No explicit awards attached to his name, but he amplifies Clip receiving a “Decade of Excellence – Digital Payment Solution Mexico” award, indicating participation in an award-winning organization rather than personal recognition. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- No listed publications, conference speaking, patents, or public open-source contributions in the profile.

Red flags:

- Lack of endorsements on core skills (product management, fintech, payments, AI) relative to his seniority level; this is more a branding gap than proof of weakness. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Only two recommendations for a 10+ year career; again, this underutilizes LinkedIn’s social proof mechanisms rather than implying negative signals. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

***

## 8. Gap analysis & red flags

| Type | Description | Evidence | Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Gap | No explicit product/fintech/AI skills listed (e.g., “Product Management,” “Payments,” “SPEI,” “Routing,” “Machine Learning”) despite strong experience. | Skills section only shows “Agile” and “Problem Solving,” while experience describes complex payments and routing work. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium – LinkedIn searchability and recruiter matching are weakened; under-signals his real capabilities. |
| Gap | Thin About section; value proposition not clearly articulated. | About is a two-sentence statement about being an engineer and believing in purpose and social equity. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium – Makes his differentiation and target roles less explicit; may reduce inbound opportunities. |
| Gap | No explicit AI depth despite “AI Orchestrator” branding. | LAFA description mentions “AI-driven backend,” but there are no concrete AI systems or methods described (no models, pipelines, or experimentation approaches). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | High for AI-focused hiring/investment – could raise skepticism among AI-native teams. |
| Gap | Limited demonstration of product frameworks/methodologies or experimentation. | No mention of A/B testing, discovery practices, analytics stack, or specific PM frameworks. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium – For top-tier PM benchmarks, this is a missing signal of how he operates. |
| Red Flag | Potential perception of title regression (Head of Product → Group PM). | Head of Product at Stori until Feb 2023, then Group Product Manager at Clip from Feb 2023. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Low–Medium – Could require explanation in interviews; likely offset by Clip’s brand and scope. |
| Red Flag | Bold financial and performance claims without external corroboration. | Claims such as 100k USD/month cost savings, 2M USD in 2 months revenue, +383% ticket Avg., -30% savings at VM, +5% approval rate. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Low–Medium – Metrics are plausible but unverifiable from profile; some hiring managers may probe deeply. |
| Ambiguity | Scope and team size as Head of Product and GPM not specified. | “Led the product team,” “oversaw squads” but no team size or direct-report counts. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium – Hard to benchmark leadership level vs. Director/CPO peers. |
| Ambiguity | Part-time nature and scope at LAFA. | Role is “Part-time,” with broad mission but no concrete deliverables or metrics yet. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Medium – For investors/partners, current focus and impact level may be unclear. |
| Ambiguity | Overlap between education entries. | Two mechatronics-related entries (IPN and UPIITA) are listed without clear structure; could confuse non-Mexican reviewers. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/) | Low – Minor clarity issue. |

## 10. Final verdict & ranking

### Tier classification

For LatAm fintech product leaders, this profile fits 🥈 **Above Average (Top 10–25%)**.

Justification (evidence points):

1. He has owned mission-critical transactional cores and delivered quantifiable impact on costs and revenue at Clip (100k USD/month savings, 2M USD revenue in 2 months, +5% approvals on QPS), which is above the norm for mid-level PMs. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
2. He has led multi-squad product organizations at Stori, culminating in a Head of Product role and participation in reaching 1M customers, indicating leadership scope beyond a single feature or pod. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
3. Earlier roles show a consistent pattern of building and optimizing POS and payments-related systems for major clients (AB InBev Modelorama, BAT) with adoption and ticket uplift metrics. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
4. Recommendations from senior leaders attest to his analytical strength, results orientation, and strong soft skills. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
5. However, the profile lacks explicit AI and data depth, structured product methodology articulation, and a visible thought-leadership footprint, which are typical among top-5% global product leaders.

### Differentiators

- Unique combination of mechatronics/hardware roots, POS device innovation, and large-scale fintech transaction-core product leadership. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Demonstrated ability to move from 0→1 (Stori credit card, Virtual Market POS and loyalty) to scaling and optimizing complex transaction systems (Clip transactional core). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Emerging but not yet fully evidenced specialization in AI-enabled mobility with an emphasis on social mobility and sustainability narratives. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

### Gap vs. top tier

To reach a true “Top Tier” (Top 1–5%) benchmark:

- He would need clearer demonstration of AI product depth (detailed examples of models, orchestration architectures, experimentation processes, and measurable AI-driven impact) and list AI/data skills explicitly. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- More explicit articulation of product strategy, frameworks, and decision-making approaches, ideally backed by public content (talks, essays, case studies). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Enhanced social proof: more recommendations, endorsements on core skills, and visible mentorship/coaching signals. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Greater thought-leadership presence in the fintech/AI/mobility space (regular posts with original insights, not just job sharing). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

### Competitive context fit

He would likely excel:

- As Group PM / Head of Product for transaction rails, acquiring, or card products in LatAm fintechs and payments companies (Clip/Stori peers, banks’ digital units, regional PSPs). [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- As an early senior PM/Product Lead in AI-driven mobility or fintech infra startups, where his transaction-core and cost-optimization experience are directly applicable. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

He might struggle (without further development):

- In top-tier AI-native product orgs expecting deep ML product and experimentation expertise (e.g., infra at leading AI labs or highly technical ML-platform teams).
- In global CPO roles, where portfolio management, org scaling, and thought leadership are critical and must be visibly demonstrated.

### Key strengths (Top 3)

1. **Transactional core and payments infrastructure impact:** Clear, quantified improvements in routing, costs, and revenue at Clip, plus multi-method payment implementations (QPS, SPEI, USD) reflecting strong infrastructure product skills. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
2. **End-to-end product delivery across card and POS ecosystems:** Multiple 0→1 launches (Stori credit card, Virtual Market POS for Modelorama, BAT loyalty) with adoption and ticket metrics show reliable delivery and commercialization. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
3. **Leadership in high-growth fintech environments:** Rapid progression at Stori and oversight of multiple squads, along with positive recommendations, demonstrate credible leadership in complex, regulated markets. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

### Critical gaps (Top 3)

1. **Under-specified AI and data capabilities:** “AI Orchestrator” branding and LAFA’s AI narrative lack specific examples, tools, or results, which can lead to skepticism in AI-focused contexts. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
2. **Incomplete skills and branding on LinkedIn:** Minimal Skills section and a vague About limit discoverability and misrepresent his actual scope and impact. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
3. **Limited public thought leadership and methodology signaling:** Sparse original content and no explicit frameworks make it harder for top-tier employers/investors to assess how he thinks and operates as a product leader. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

## Missing or uncertain information

- Skills/endorsement counts are not visible beyond the existence of “Agile” and “Problem Solving,” so endorsement quantity and quality are unknown. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- LAFA’s current metrics (rides, unit economics, AI system performance) are absent; his AI orchestration impact is therefore unverified from the profile alone. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- Team size, reporting structure, and budget responsibility in Head of Product and GPM roles are not specified, limiting leadership-level benchmarking. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)
- No external artifacts (talks, case studies, code, papers) are linked, so cross-verification of the more aggressive metrics (e.g., 2M USD in 2 months, +383% ticket, -30% savings) depends on direct conversations rather than public evidence. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levi-eliel-garcia-sosa/)

All of these reduce precision in benchmarking against top-1% global product leaders but do not contradict the narrative of a strong, impact-oriented LatAm fintech product leader.

## Evaluacion de Fit para LAFA

The LinkedIn audit above evaluates Levi as a product professional. This section evaluates whether his specific capabilities match what LAFA needs from its Head of Product — and specifically whether he can effectively supervise an AI Product Engineer.

### Can he supervise an AI engineer?

**Assessment: PARTIALLY — good PM instincts, but cannot provide technical mentorship.**

Levi has 12-13 years of PM experience across payments infrastructure (Clip transactional core, routing engine, clearing house connectivity), credit card lifecycle (Stori, 1M customers), and POS/hardware (Virtual Market). He understands product delivery, OKRs, stakeholder alignment, and the cadence of shipping complex technical products.

**However:** His "AI Orchestrator" title is aspirational, not evidenced. He has no visible AI/ML experience. He cannot do code review, evaluate model architectures, or guide data infrastructure decisions. The AI Product Engineer would be technically unsupervised — Levi can say "what to build" but not "how to build it well."

**Practical implication for Jose:** Expect Levi to be an excellent product partner (prioritization, stakeholder management, user requirements) but not a technical mentor. Jose must be self-sufficient on architecture and ML decisions. This is viable if Jose is comfortable as a senior IC, but it means zero peer review on technical choices.

### Can he prioritize a technical roadmap?

**Assessment: YES — strong signal from interview and track record.**

In the interview (Feb 6, 2026), Levi demonstrated clear prioritization instincts:
- Recognized "everything is spreadsheets" as blocker before any AI
- Prioritized dashboard for stakeholder transparency
- Correctly deprioritized credit scoring (no data yet)
- Scoped down onboarding (speed > sophistication)

At Clip, he managed the transactional core (routing, PCI, settlement) — a system where wrong prioritization has immediate financial consequences ($100K/month in routing savings proves this). At Stori, he led 4 squads simultaneously (Delivery, Transactional Core, Payment Channels, Customer Service).

**Risk:** He's part-time at LAFA (Nov 2025-Present). Part-time supervision of a roadmap that requires daily trade-offs on a 42-week timeline is a structural risk. If Levi goes full-time, this risk resolves. If not, Jose will need to self-prioritize frequently.

### Does his fintech experience translate to fleet ops?

**Assessment: PARTIALLY — strong on payments, weak on physical operations.**

**Transferable:** Payment processing (Conekta/SPEI integration maps directly to his Clip experience), credit risk concepts (Stori underwriting background), weekly billing cycles (similar to subscription commerce), collections automation (mapped to his delinquency work at Stori).

**Not transferable:** Vehicle logistics, maintenance scheduling, OEM relationships, charging infrastructure operations, telematics/IoT data pipelines, battery health monitoring. These are physical-world operations that Levi has never managed. His POS hardware experience at Virtual Market is the closest analog, but the gap is significant.

**Practical implication:** Levi will be strong on the fintech side of LAFA (payments, scoring, collections — P0.1, P2, P3) but may underestimate complexity on the fleet side (battery monitoring, charging optimization, maintenance — P4, P5, P0.3). Jose should be prepared to educate upward on fleet/IoT complexity.

### Overall Fit Verdict

Levi is a credible Head of Product for LAFA's current stage. His PM fundamentals are strong, his fintech background covers half of LAFA's tech stack needs, and his interview demonstrated pragmatic prioritization. He is NOT a CTO and should not be evaluated as one — he's a PM who happens to be the first product hire's boss.

**What Jose should expect working under Levi:**
- Clear product direction and good stakeholder management
- No technical mentorship or architecture guidance
- Part-time availability (until/unless he goes full-time)
- Strong alignment on fintech projects (payments, scoring, collections)
- Need to educate on fleet/IoT complexity and timelines
- A collaborative rather than directive management style (interview signals: empathetic, open to input, Stori culture)
