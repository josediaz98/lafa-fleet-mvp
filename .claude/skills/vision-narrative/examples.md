# Vision Narrative Examples

Real-world case studies illustrating the Problem-Solution-Resolution framework and the four attributes of great vision narratives.

## 1. Netflix vs Blockbuster: The Local Maxima Pathology

**Concept Illustrated:** Vision as time-buying; the danger of optimizing what currently works

**The Strategic Move:**
Netflix's leadership was willing to **trade near-term certainty for long-term positioning**, then align the organization to that destination. The key is not that Netflix "had vision" in an inspirational sense — it's that they chose an investment that looks irrational under current constraints but inevitable under a longer time horizon.

**The Blockbuster Pathology:**
Blockbuster optimized what currently worked and became extremely efficient at a business model the market was abandoning. This is **local maxima**: if you only optimize what currently works, you miss the structural shift. Their executives optimized for quarterly performance through incremental improvements (more stores, fee optimization), which hit short-term targets while losing the war.

**PM Translation:**
If your scope has no "destination," your roadmap becomes a sequence of plausible improvements that never create a step-change in user value. Competitors (or adjacent teams) will eventually define the future for you.

**The Failure Mode:** No vision leads to local optimization leads to competitors outpacing you. A roadmap full of "reasonable" work that never changes the game.

## 2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Aspirational Reframing

**Concept Illustrated:** How aspiration unlocks resourcing (Attribute: Aspirational)

**Case Study (Sachin Rekhi, former PM lead):**

| Version | Vision | Outcome |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Incremental** | "Port desktop to mobile" | Limited resourcing; leadership saw it as a feature migration |
| **Aspirational** | "Pre-meeting sales intelligence at a glance" | Leadership greenlights building a dedicated team |

The aspiration made it easier for leadership to invest because the target outcome was plausibly material. The first framing was a platform task; the second was a user outcome that could move the business.

**The Causal Chain:**
```
Non-aspirational vision -> Small problems -> Small impact -> Not needle-moving ->
Leadership won't buy in -> No time or resources -> Self-fulfilling constraint loop
```

**Socialization Insight:**
Sachin Rekhi also used the Sales Navigator context to demonstrate the **Narration** persuasion style: "Start your day in Salesforce vs start your day in Sales Navigator" — a before/after contrast that compressed complexity into experience.

**Takeaway:** One of the most common leadership critiques is "the vision isn't aspirational enough." If you're repeatedly having to justify why your area deserves resources, the issue may be upstream — your vision is framed as incremental throughput rather than outcome-scale.

## 3. Blue Origin: Opinionated Specificity

**Concept Illustrated:** Staking a specific POV on solution shape (Attribute: Opinionated)

**Jeff Bezos' vision for Blue Origin:**

| Level | Statement |
|-------|-----------|
| **Vague** | "Go to space" |
| **Opinionated** | "Build toward O'Neill colonies — spinning cylinders that replicate gravity and sustain life" |

**Why It Matters:**
The specificity acts like a filter: it steers the team toward solving artificial gravity rather than, say, terraforming Mars. Without it, you can spend years building the wrong foundation, then face a demoralizing, expensive reset.

By naming O'Neill colonies specifically, Bezos constrained the entire R&D direction. Engineers know what physics problems to solve, what manufacturing capabilities to develop, what intermediate milestones matter. The opinionated bet eliminates entire categories of ambiguity.

**Takeaway:** You're not merely describing a general aspiration — you are staking a specific point of view on the **shape of the solution**. The specificity is the strategy.

## 4. Slack: User-Centric Organizational Transformation

**Concept Illustrated:** Anchoring vision on user benefit, not technical achievement (Attribute: User-Centric)

**Stewart Butterfield's Framing:**
Slack's vision was framed as explicitly user-centric: the product exists in service of **"organizational transformation."** Software is the shipped artifact, not the point.

**Why This Works:**
- The user benefit (transformed organizational communication) is the anchor, not the technology
- This kept the team focused on user outcomes rather than feature checklists
- It enabled bold decisions about what NOT to build (anything that didn't serve organizational transformation)

**Results:**
- ~93% retention at 2014 Series D
- >$1B valuation within two years of first product launch

**Contrast with Google Wave** (see below): Both were communication tools. Slack succeeded by centering on user need; Wave failed by centering on technical novelty.

**Takeaway:** When you lose the user benefit, you lose the best forcing function for needle-moving ambition. Two common traps: (1) visions that primarily emphasize how the company wins, and (2) visions that emphasize technical novelty without clear user need.

## 5. Google Wave: Technical Novelty Without User Need (Cautionary Tale)

**Concept Illustrated:** What happens when vision lacks user-centricity (Attribute: User-Centric failure)

**What Happened:**
- Technically ambitious, heavily covered by media
- Lacked a clear core problem for users
- Combined email, instant messaging, and wiki collaboration in a novel but confusing way
- Shuttered **50 days after public launch** due to low adoption

**Why It Failed:**
Google Wave was an answer to "what cool thing can we build?" rather than "what painful problem do users need solved?" The technical novelty was real, but without a user-centric anchor, there was no forcing function to keep the product coherent or the team aligned on what success looked like.

**PM Translation:**
Technical ambition without user grounding produces impressive demos and empty usage graphs. The vision lacked the "Resolution" phase — no one could describe how the world concretely changed for users.

**Takeaway:** If you can't describe a user's transformed day-in-the-life, you don't have a user-centric vision. You have a technology showcase.

## 6. Notejoy: Ideas Spread Virally (Opinionated Model)

**Concept Illustrated:** Opinionated mental model that shapes architecture (Attribute: Opinionated)

**Sachin Rekhi's Vision for Notejoy:**

**The Opinionated Model:** "Ideas spread within organizations the way content spreads on social media — virally."

**Why This Works:**
- Designers and engineers know the metaphor (social media viral mechanics)
- They know the mechanics to emulate (sharing, discovery, feeds)
- Future-facing elements become obvious: "library overviews" and "weekly newsletters" should shape architecture decisions today
- The team can make autonomous decisions about features because the model is specific enough to constrain choices

**Resolution Moment:** "Love this. When can this happen?" — compresses adoption and urgency into a single moment. The resolution works because it captures the emotional response of a user who sees the vision realized.

**Takeaway:** An opinionated model gives the team a shared mental framework. When someone proposes a feature, the team can ask: "Does this fit the viral-spread-of-ideas model?" That's empowerment — they don't need the PM to arbitrate.

## 7. Airbnb Guidebooks: Socialization Failure Warning

**Concept Illustrated:** Success can still be killed without proper buy-in (Socialization)

**What Happened:**
A product initiative at Airbnb that performed well by its own metrics but was still killed because it violated leadership's deeper values or strategic priorities.

**The Lesson:**
Something can perform well and still be killed if it doesn't have proper socialization with the gatekeepers. That's not a product failure; it's a **socialization failure**.

**Anti-Patterns This Illustrates:**

1. **The Async Dump:** Publishing vision in wiki/Slack and assuming absorption. Magical thinking — especially with senior leaders.
2. **The Drive-By Mention:** Briefly referencing the vision in a review, then disappearing into execution details. Creates false sense of alignment while leaders never actually adopt the mental model.

**The Real Cost:** Not just "less excitement" — it's rework and reversals. The PM job is not only to craft the vision narrative but also to translate it into roadmap logic repeatedly, until stakeholders can retell it. If they can't retell it, they don't actually own it.

**Takeaway:** Buy-in is a continuous loop, not a one-time presentation. Embed vision into existing decision systems (product review, QBR, design review) rather than presenting it as a standalone event.

## 8. Lyft: Vivid Problem + Sensory Resolution

**Concept Illustrated:** The full Problem-Solution-Resolution arc executed with emotional resonance; sensory language in resolution

**Author:** Logan Green (co-founder and CEO)

This is an exemplary vision narrative because it demonstrates all four attributes — aspirational, detailed, opinionated, and user-centric — within a vivid narrative arc.

---

### The Problem: A Country Built for Cars

The narrative opens with a personal anecdote — falling in love with cars through Hot Wheels, Micromachines, and trips to the New York Auto Show — then pivots to an epiphany: "Cars weren't just shaping my worldview; they were shaping the world, itself."

**The thought exercise that makes it visceral:**

> "Next time you walk outside, pay really close attention to the space around you. Look at how much land is devoted to cars — and nothing else. How much space parked cars take up lining both sides of the street, and how much of our cities go unused covered by parking lots."

This is not abstract policy argument. It turns the reader into an active observer of the problem. The data follows:

- The average vehicle is used only **4% of the time** and parked the other 96%
- Americans spend more than **$2 trillion every year** on car ownership — more than on food
- 250 million cars in America, and the equivalent of **240 million are parked at all times**
- More than **700 million parking spaces** in the U.S. — over 6,000 square miles, bigger than Connecticut
- Average American spends **$9,000/year** on car ownership

**Historical grounding — America's transportation revolutions:**
1. **First revolution (1800s):** Canals and railroads linked communities, transformed outposts into thriving cities (Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles)
2. **Second revolution (1900s):** Assembly line automobiles brought individual freedom but reshaped cities around cars — highways split neighborhoods, 4,000 houses demolished for the LA Four Level Interchange, streets widened at the expense of sidewalks and community spaces

The narrative shows how streets used to be public spaces — where children played, neighbors socialized, and small businesses thrived — then were systematically reclaimed for cars. Fewer people outside meant less foot traffic, which hurt small businesses, reduced safety ("eyes on the street"), and strip malls replaced community gathering places.

**The hotel metaphor:**

> "Can you imagine a hotel where almost every room is empty? A hotel that spends an enormous amount of money maintaining those empty rooms, no matter how little they're used? It would go out of business tomorrow. And if you think about occupancy of cars the same way, the observation is simple: America is running a failing transportation business."

**Why it's getting worse:** By 2050, almost 100 million more people will move to American cities. Not enough space, housing, or public transit to accommodate this influx while keeping cities livable.

### The Solution: The Third Transportation Revolution

**Opinionated bet — three key shifts:**

**1. Autonomous vehicle fleets will become widespread (majority of Lyft rides within 5 years).**

This is where the narrative stakes a specific, controversial position against Elon Musk's model of individual car owners renting their vehicles:

> "Elon is right that a network of vehicles is critical, but the transition to an autonomous future will not occur primarily through individually owned cars."

The reasoning is detailed:
- Fleet provides more consistency and availability than patchwork of privately owned cars
- Individual owners won't want to rent to strangers
- Passengers expect clean, well-maintained vehicles — best achieved through fleet operations
- Lyft's core competency (maximizing utilization, managing peak hours) translates to autonomous networks

**2. By 2025, private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S. cities.**

Supported by data:
- Driver's licenses for 20-24 year olds: 92% (1983) to 77% (2014)
- Driver's licenses for 16 year olds: 46% (1983) to 24% (2014)
- Millennials are 30% less likely to buy a car than previous generation

**3. Cities' physical environment will transform more than in our lifetimes.**

> "Transportation doesn't just impact how we get from place to place. It shapes what those places look like, and the lives of the people who live there."

**Detailed mechanism — the hybrid network:**
The narrative names specific phases and constraints rather than hand-waving:
- Phase 1 (current): Human-driven network
- Phase 2 (hybrid): Mix of limited-capability autonomous + human-driven vehicles
- Phase 3 (fully autonomous): All rides autonomous

Even within the hybrid phase, the narrative is specific: "Lyft could initially have a fleet of autonomous cars that completes rides under 25 miles per hour on flat, dry roads. Then upgrade to 35 mph. And so on."

**Counter-intuitive insight on driver demand:**
"In the first five or more years following the introduction of autonomous vehicles, the need for human drivers will actually increase, not decrease" — because cheaper rides grow the overall market faster than autonomy can absorb it.

**Subscription model details:**
- Pay-as-you-go for a few cents per mile
- Unlimited mileage plans
- Premium packages with upgraded vehicles
- Network absorbs fuel, maintenance, parking, insurance costs and passes savings through

### The Resolution: Cities Built Around People, Not Cars

The resolution is **intentionally sensory and spatial** — not abstract outcomes but observable physical changes:

> "Imagine for a minute, what our world could look like if we found a way to take most of these cars off the road. It would be a world with less traffic and less pollution. A world where we need less parking — where streets can be narrowed and sidewalks widened. It's a world where we can construct new housing and small businesses on parking lots across the country — or turn them into green spaces and parks. That's a world built around people, not cars."

**Concrete evidence it's already happening:**

- **New York City:** Under Mayor Bloomberg, reclaimed 180 acres of roads from vehicles. Parking lot below Manhattan Bridge became a plaza. Retail sales in surrounding area increased 172% within 5 years.
- **San Francisco:** Historic Ferry Building was blocked by a two-level freeway for decades. After the 1989 earthquake damaged the road, the city tore down the highway instead of rebuilding it. Created shops, restaurants, cafes. 25,000 people visit its farmers market every weekend. 51% more housing in surrounding area within 5 years.
- **Washington, DC:** Georgetown district widening sidewalks.
- **Phoenix and Portland:** Replacing parking lots with parks, cafes, meeting spaces. Tearing up pavement and planting trees.
- **Global:** Seoul to Barcelona — taking back cities is a worldwide phenomenon.

**Infrastructure imperative:** American Society of Civil Engineers gave U.S. infrastructure a D+, estimating $3.6 trillion in needed investment. The argument: "If we have to rebuild and revitalize our roads and cities anyway, let's do it in a way that puts people, not cars, at the center of our future."

**Emotional close:**

> "When I look at the world through my 9-month-old baby girl's beautiful eyes, I know what we have to do. We must come together and grab this golden ticket to redesign an even greater home. A home that drives community — not cars — to the center of our everyday life."

### Why This Narrative Works (Four-Attribute Check)

| Attribute | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Aspirational** | Pass | "End private car ownership in major cities" and "third transportation revolution" — forces thinking far beyond quarterly product releases |
| **Detailed** | Pass | Names three phases of autonomous transition, specific subscription tiers, hybrid network mechanics, speed thresholds for autonomous capability rollout |
| **Opinionated** | Pass | Explicitly disagrees with Musk's individual-ownership model; stakes the fleet-based approach; predicts driver demand will increase before decreasing |
| **User-Centric** | Pass | Every section returns to how people's lives, cities, and communities transform — not Lyft's revenue or market share |
