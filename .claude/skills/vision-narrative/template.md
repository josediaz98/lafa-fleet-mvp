# Vision Narrative: [Scope Name]

> [Date] | [Author] | Time Horizon: [X years]

## Executive Abstract

[One paragraph summary for skimmers. Compress the entire narrative into 3-4 sentences: the problem's scale, the opinionated bet on how to solve it, and the user impact when realized. This should be specific enough that a reader who goes no further still understands the direction and can make basic trade-off decisions.]

---

## The Problem

[1-2 pages. Paint the problem vividly and aspirationally. The reader should FEEL the problem's scale and urgency, not just understand it intellectually.]

[Start with a specific anecdote, scenario, or thought exercise that makes the problem tangible. Ground it in a real person's experience.]

[Expand to show scale: data points that make the magnitude visceral, not abstract. Use specific numbers, not percentages in isolation.]

[Show why the problem is getting worse or why the opportunity is growing. Establish structural inevitability — this isn't a quarterly convenience, it's a tectonic shift.]

[End with the aspiration: "Imagine for a minute what the world could look like if..." — transition from pain to possibility.]

## The Solution

[1-2 pages. Describe the future state with enough specificity that teams can backchain strategies and roadmaps from it.]

[State your opinionated bet on HOW to solve this — not just "it will be solved" but the specific mechanism, architecture, or model you believe in. This is where you stake a point of view.]

[Name the solution elements and intermediate landmarks. What are the 2-3 key shifts that must happen? What does each phase look like?]

[Address what you are explicitly NOT doing. The "not doing" list is as important as the "doing" list for enabling autonomous team decisions.]

[Explain why this approach specifically — what makes your bet different from the obvious alternatives? What insight or advantage makes this the right shape for the solution?]

[Connect to present-day strategy. This should feel like "strategy with the time horizon turned up," not fantasy. Show the continuity between what you're doing now and where this leads.]

## The Resolution

[0.5-1 page. Concrete, user-centric description of how the world changes. Sensory, specific. This is where executives FEEL the magnitude.]

[Describe a day in the life AFTER the vision is realized. What does the user do differently? What has disappeared from their experience? What new capabilities do they have?]

[Use sensory and spatial language — not "improved efficiency" but the concrete, observable changes in the user's world.]

[End with a forward-looking statement that creates urgency and collective responsibility.]

## Four-Attribute Check

| Attribute | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Aspirational** | [Pass/Fail] | [Does it force bigger thinking than current sprint scope? What needle does it move?] |
| **Detailed** | [Pass/Fail] | [Can multiple people build toward the same destination without constant alignment? What solution elements are named?] |
| **Opinionated** | [Pass/Fail] | [What specific POV does it stake? What alternatives does it reject?] |
| **User-Centric** | [Pass/Fail] | [Is the anchor user benefit or company benefit? Can you name the user and their transformed experience?] |

## Implications

[What must be true in product, technology, data, and organization to realize this vision. List the prerequisites — if you can't write these, the vision is under-specified.]

**Product:**
- [Capability or feature that must exist]
- [Integration or partnership required]

**Technology:**
- [Architecture decision or infrastructure needed]
- [Data model or pipeline required]

**Organization:**
- [Team structure, hiring, or skill gap to address]
- [Process or workflow change needed]

**Data:**
- [Data assets that must be collected or connected]
- [Analytics or ML capability required]

## Roadmap Bridge

[How the next 2-3 quarters connect to this vision. If you can't write this, the vision isn't yet fundable.]

**3 bets we are making because of this vision:**
1. [Bet 1: What we're building and why it's a stepping stone toward the vision]
2. [Bet 2: What foundational work we're investing in and how it connects]
3. [Bet 3: What we're learning or validating to reduce uncertainty]

**2 things we are intentionally NOT doing:**
1. [Thing 1: What we're saying no to and why, given this vision]
2. [Thing 2: What we're deferring and the logic behind the sequencing]

## Socialization Plan

| Stakeholder | Forum | Persuasion Style | Key Message |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| [Name/Role — gatekeeper who controls resourcing] | [Meeting/venue where you'll embed the vision] | [Framing / Social Proof / Goal Seek / Inception / Citation / Narration] | [One sentence tailored to this stakeholder] |
| [Name/Role] | [Meeting/venue] | [Style] | [Key message] |
| [Name/Role] | [Meeting/venue] | [Style] | [Key message] |

**Socialization sequence:**
1. Pressure-test with [1-2 high-trust peers]
2. Pre-wire [gatekeeper(s)] in 1:1
3. Bring to [official forum] as a decision event, not a presentation

## Decision Heuristics

[5-7 principles derived from this vision that resolve common tactical debates — enabling team autonomy. Teams don't need you if they can predict your answer because the direction is internalized.]

1. **[Heuristic name]:** [When faced with X, we choose Y because Z]
2. **[Heuristic name]:** [When faced with X, we choose Y because Z]
3. **[Heuristic name]:** [When faced with X, we choose Y because Z]
4. **[Heuristic name]:** [When faced with X, we choose Y because Z]
5. **[Heuristic name]:** [When faced with X, we choose Y because Z]
