# Communication Plan: [Initiative Name]

> [Date] | [Author] | Phase: [Discovery / Planning / Execution / Iteration]

## Communication Objective

[One paragraph: What outcome does this communication plan serve? E.g., "Gain leadership approval for the unified platform strategy and align the cross-functional team on a Q2 execution plan."]

---

## Culture Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Company format norm** | [Presentation-heavy / Written-first / Transitional / Async-heavy — what does your organization default to?] |
| **Meeting culture** | [Meeting-heavy (decisions in meetings) / Meeting-light (async decisions) / Mixed] |
| **Subculture notes** | [Any function-specific preferences? E.g., "Engineering prefers written RFCs; leadership prefers slide decks"] |
| **Your credibility level** | [New to org (conform strictly) / Established (can deviate strategically)] |

**Culture strategy:** [Conform to norms / Supplement with preferred format / Strategically deviate — and why]

---

## Audience-Delivery Matrix

Map each audience segment to format, channel, and proactive mode:

| Audience | Goal | Format | Channel | Proactive Mode | Timing |
|----------|------|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| [E.g., VP Product] | [Inform / Decide / Approve / Review] | [Presentation / Written / Video / Conversation / Design] | [Large meeting / Small meeting / 1:1 / Email-Slack / Workshop] | [Pitch / Pre-Sell / Inform / Report / Workshop] | [When — specific date or phase] |
| [E.g., Engineering team] | | | | | |
| [E.g., Dependent stakeholder] | | | | | |
| [E.g., Company-wide] | | | | | |

---

## Format Plan

For each format you'll produce, specify what it contains and who it serves:

| Format | Purpose | Primary Audience | Contents | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| [E.g., "Written one-pager"] | [Pre-read for leadership approval] | [VP Product, VP Engineering] | [Executive summary, PRAA story, financial model, timeline] | [Draft / Ready / Delivered] |
| [E.g., "Presentation deck"] | [Live delivery at leadership review] | [All leadership] | [Problem narrative, result vision, phased action plan, ask slide] | |
| [E.g., "Technical diagram"] | [Architecture context for engineering] | [Engineering team + dependent teams] | [System architecture, data flow, integration points] | |
| [E.g., "Video summary"] | [Company-wide announcement"] | [All employees] | [3-minute overview of initiative and impact] | |

---

## Channel Plan

For each channel you'll use, specify the logistics:

| Channel | Audience | When | Duration | Preparation Needed |
|---------|----------|------|----------|-------------------|
| [E.g., "1:1 with VP Engineering"] | [VP Engineering] | [Week of March 3] | [30 min] | [Written pre-read sent 2 days before; feedback version of story (50-75% complete)] |
| [E.g., "Leadership review meeting"] | [All leadership] | [March 10] | [60 min] | [Pre-sells complete; final presentation + diagrams; Q&A prep] |
| [E.g., "Team inception workshop"] | [Product team + dependent engineering] | [March 12-13] | [2 days] | [Story adapted for team; sliders exercise prepared; scoping draft ready] |
| [E.g., "Slack update"] | [Informed stakeholders] | [Bi-weekly starting March 17] | [5 min read] | [Template for status updates] |

---

## Pre-Sell Execution Plan

[The pre-sell LEVEL per stakeholder comes from `/stakeholder-map`. Here, plan the delivery logistics.]

| Stakeholder | Pre-Sell Method | Format | Channel | Timing | What You'll Bring | What You'll Learn |
|------------|----------------|--------|---------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| [Name] | [Co-creation / Feedback / Advice / Pre-read] | [Written draft / Presentation excerpt / Conversation] | [1:1 meeting / Email] | [Date] | [What % of story, at what fidelity] | [Questions to answer, intelligence to gather] |
| [Name] | | | | | | |
| [Name] | | | | | | |

**Pre-sell sequence rationale:** [Why this order? How does each conversation build on the previous one?]

---

## Reactive Preparation

### Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

**Problem:** [One sentence — the vivid, felt problem]

**Result:** [One sentence — the compelling destination]

**Action:** [One sentence — the credible path]

**Ask:** [One sentence — the specific request]

### Talking Points (3-5 Key Arguments)

1. [Talking point #1 — the single most important argument for this initiative]
2. [Talking point #2 — the evidence that makes it believable]
3. [Talking point #3 — the strategic connection that makes it relevant now]
4. [Talking point #4 — the risk mitigation or phasing that makes it feasible]
5. [Talking point #5 — the team/resource readiness argument]

### Q&A Preparation

| Likely Question | Concise Answer | Supporting Evidence |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| How does this impact company/org goals? | [1-2 sentences] | [Data point or reference] |
| How did you validate the opportunity? | [1-2 sentences] | [Research, data, customer evidence] |
| What other options did you evaluate? | [1-2 sentences] | [Alternatives considered and why this approach won] |
| Why do we need to do this now? | [1-2 sentences] | [Urgency driver — competitive, customer, strategic] |
| How does this impact other work? | [1-2 sentences] | [What gets deprioritized; mitigation plan] |
| [Initiative-specific question #1] | | |
| [Initiative-specific question #2] | | |
| [Initiative-specific question #3] | | |

## Confidence Preparation

### Prepare-Practice-Feedback Plan

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Prepare** | [Write out story outline; define talking points; build Q&A bank] | [By when] |
| **Practice** | [Record yourself delivering the story; practice with [specific person]; memorize STRUCTURE not words] | [By when] |
| **Feedback** | [Run through with [trusted colleague]; ask specifically: "Was it clear? Convincing? Right format?"] | [By when] |

### "Room of Supporters" Strategy

[Which stakeholders have been pre-sold and will be supportive in the formal meeting? How does their presence change the dynamic?]

- [Name] — Pre-sold via [method]. Expected to [support vocally / ask planned question / stay neutral].
- [Name] — Pre-sold via [method]. Expected to [behavior].

## Delivery Sequence Timeline

Map the complete communication sequence from first conversation to ongoing updates:

|------|-----|--------|----------|--------|---------|------|
| [W1] | [Mon] | [E.g., "Pre-sell 1:1"] | [VP Engineering] | [Written draft] | [1:1 meeting] | [Surface technical objections; get feedback] |
| [W1] | [Wed] | [E.g., "Pre-sell 1:1"] | [VP Product] | [Updated draft] | [1:1 meeting] | [Incorporate VP Eng feedback; get strategic alignment] |

| [W2] | [Thu] | [E.g., "Leadership review"] | [All leadership] | [Presentation + diagrams] | [Large meeting] | [Ratify pre-sold alignment; secure approval] |
| [W3] | [Mon-Tue] | [E.g., "Team inception"] | [Product team] | [Workshop materials] | [Workshop] | [Convert story into execution plan] |
| [W3+] | [Ongoing] | [E.g., "Bi-weekly updates"] | [Informed stakeholders] | [Written update] | [Email/Slack] | [Maintain alignment during execution] |

---

## Post-Delivery Plan

| Phase | Action | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| **After pre-sells** | [Incorporate feedback into final story; update format and content based on what you learned] | [Date] |
| **After formal approval** | [Send summary of decisions and next steps to all attendees; share with informed stakeholders] | [Within 24 hours of meeting] |
| **After team inception** | [Distribute inception outputs — scope, milestones, epics, risks — to all participants + sponsors] | [Within 48 hours of inception] |
| **During execution** | [Establish reporting cadence — what you communicate, to whom, how often] | [Define schedule] |
| **Post-launch** | [Report mode — share results, connect back to original story promise, acknowledge what worked and what didn't] | [After key milestone] |
