## GoDaddy Meeting Culture — Navigating a Channel Constraint

### Concept Illustrated: How company culture acts as a constraint function on channel selection, and how to work within it

**Context:** GoDaddy had a strong meeting culture. Decisions were expected to happen in meetings, and individuals would be offended if excluded from meetings where decisions were being discussed. This created a channel constraint: nearly all storytelling had to happen through large meetings, regardless of whether that channel was optimal.

### The Challenge

A PM needed to pitch a new partner tools initiative. The optimal channel according to the decision matrix would be: 1:1 pre-sells → small meeting for decision → email updates for execution. But GoDaddy's culture demanded: everyone relevant must be in the room when the decision is discussed.

### How the PM Adapted

| Matrix Recommendation | Cultural Reality | Adaptation |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Pre-sell in 1:1s | 1:1s were fine for informal conversations | Used 1:1s for pre-sell as recommended — culture supported this |
| Small meeting for decision | Large meeting expected — exclusion = offense | Held the formal pitch in a large meeting, but pre-sold to key leaders first so the large meeting became a ratification |
| Email for execution updates | People wanted to be in meetings | Added a brief standing meeting for execution updates, supplemented with email |

### The Format Decision

GoDaddy was format-flexible — "loose guidelines, but folks could pick any format they prefer." The PM chose:
- **Presentation** for the large meeting (high-level narrative + visuals)
- **Written pre-read** sent 24 hours before the meeting (details for anyone who wanted depth)
- **Diagram** for the technical architecture (included in the presentation and shared separately with engineering)

### Key Takeaway

The cultural constraint was on *channel* (meetings), not *format*. The PM worked within the meeting culture while optimizing format and using pre-sells to ensure the large meeting produced the right outcome. Over time, GoDaddy recognized the inefficiency and shifted toward smaller meetings and Slack — but that was an organizational transition, not a PM's individual battle.

## PandaDoc Written Mandate — Storytelling on the Page

### Concept Illustrated: How written-first cultures require different storytelling skills and create different advantages

**Context:** PandaDoc mandated that all major product communications use written one-pager format — similar to Amazon's memo culture. No slide decks for decisions.

### Format Implications

| Dimension | How Written Culture Changed the Approach |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Story structure** | PRAA had to work as prose, not as slides with speaker notes |
| **Evidence presentation** | Data tables and charts embedded in the document, not animated on screen |
| **Emotional content** | Customer stories written as narrative paragraphs, not as quote slides |
| **The ask** | Explicitly stated at the end of the document with specific numbers |
| **Audience engagement** | Meeting time spent discussing the pre-read, not listening to a presentation |

### The OKR Process Story in Written Format

The PM pitching the OKR process change (see `/story-arc` examples) adapted the delivery:

**Document structure:**
1. Executive summary (3 sentences — the PRAA compressed)
2. The Problem (1 page — Alex's standup scenario + $200K overlap waste)
3. The Proposed Result (half page — what changes for teams and leadership)
4. Action Plan (half page — pilot with 3 teams)
5. The Ask (3 bullet points — volunteer teams, VP time, pilot timeline)
6. Appendix: supporting evidence (referenced but not in main flow)

**Meeting format:**
- Document distributed 24 hours before the meeting
- First 10 minutes: silent reading (for anyone who hadn't read it)
- Remaining 50 minutes: discussion, questions, decision

### Advantages of Written Culture

| Advantage | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Forces clarity | You can't hide behind charisma or slide design — ideas must stand on their own |
| Levels the playing field | Introverts and extroverts have equal impact — the document speaks for everyone |
| Creates durable artifacts | The one-pager becomes the reference document throughout execution |
| Enables async inclusion | People who couldn't attend the meeting still engage with the full story |

### Key Takeaway

Written-first cultures are harder for PMs who rely on presentation skills but easier for those who think clearly. The same PRAA structure works — the format changes, not the story. If your company is transitioning to written, invest in writing skills early.

## BILL Culture Transition — Navigating Format Uncertainty

### Concept Illustrated: How to operate when the organization is shifting from one format culture to another

**Context:** BILL's majority used presentation-based formats but was starting to move toward written formats. PMs faced uncertainty: which format would a given leader expect?

### The Dual-Format Strategy

The PM's approach: create the story in both formats and use the audience's preference to determine which to lead with.

| Audience | Primary Format | Supplement | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Senior leadership (old guard) | Presentation | Written appendix with detail | Comfortable with slides; written doc available for deep divers |
| New leadership hires | Written one-pager | Diagram supplement | Came from written-first companies; expected memos |
| Engineering team | Written RFC | Technical diagram | Engineering subculture was already written-first |
| Design team | Presentation + Figma prototype | Design walkthrough | Design culture values visual storytelling |

### Key Takeaway

During transitions, the safest approach is: (1) build the core story in the emerging format (written), (2) create a derivative in the established format (presentation), (3) lead with whichever the specific audience prefers. The investment in creating both formats is small compared to the risk of mismatching.

## Spotify Guilds — Multi-Audience Delivery Sequence

### Concept Illustrated: How a complex initiative requires a carefully sequenced delivery plan across multiple audiences

**Context:** A Spotify PM proposing a new cross-team guild model (communities of practice across squads) needed alignment from engineering leadership, tribe leads, and individual engineers — each requiring different format, channel, and mode.

### Delivery Sequence

| Week | Audience | Mode | Format | Channel | Goal |
|------|----------|------|--------|---------|------|
| W1 Mon | Engineering Director | Pre-Sell (Advice) | Conversation + sketch | 1:1 lunch | Test the concept; get directional support |
| W1 Wed | 2 Tribe Leads | Pre-Sell (Feedback) | Written 1-pager (60% done) | 1:1 meetings | Get feedback on structure; surface concerns about tribe autonomy |
| W2 Mon | Engineering Director | Pre-Sell (Feedback) | Updated 1-pager incorporating tribe lead input | 1:1 follow-up | Show tribe leads' feedback is reflected; get approval to proceed |
| W2 Thu | All Tribe Leads (6) | Pitch | Presentation | Small meeting (8 people) | Ratify pre-sold alignment; answer remaining questions |
| W3 Mon-Tue | Interested engineers (30) | Workshop | Workshop materials + Miro | 2-day workshop | Co-create the guild charter, meeting cadence, and first projects |
| W3 Fri | All engineers | Inform | Video + written summary | Email + Slack | Announce the guild program with clear "how to join" instructions |
| W4+ | Engineering org | Inform | Written updates | Slack channel | Bi-weekly updates on guild progress |

### Why This Sequence Worked

Each step served a specific purpose in the influence chain:
- **W1 1:1s** surfaced the two biggest concerns (tribe autonomy, time commitment) before they could become group-setting objections
- **W2 follow-up** showed the Engineering Director that feedback was incorporated — building trust
- **W2 small meeting** was a ratification, not a debate — all concerns were already addressed
- **W3 workshop** created ownership among early participants — they became the evangelists
- **W3 company announcement** benefited from early adopter enthusiasm

### Key Takeaway

The sequence maps directly to the mode progression: Pre-Sell → Pitch → Workshop → Inform. Each mode serves a different relationship dynamic and produces a different outcome. Sequencing them correctly creates compounding momentum.

## Anti-Pattern: The Reactive Fumble

### Concept Illustrated: What happens when a PM has no story kit prepared and gets caught in a surprise pitch

**Context:** A PM was in a weekly leadership standup — a routine meeting where teams give 2-minute updates. The CEO, who rarely attended this meeting, dropped in and asked: "I heard your team is working on something with the data pipeline. What's the story there?"

### What Happened

The PM had been working on a data pipeline initiative for 3 weeks and had a strong story — but had never condensed it into an elevator pitch or prepared talking points. Here's how it went:

| What the PM Said | What the CEO Heard |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Yeah, so we've been looking at the data pipeline and there's a lot of technical debt from the original architecture and we've been talking to the data team about how to restructure it and basically we think we should migrate to a new system but we need to evaluate a few vendors first..." | Long, unfocused, no clear problem or outcome — sounds like the PM doesn't have a clear plan |
| (2 minutes of technical details) | Over-indexed on HOW without establishing WHY |
| "...so yeah, we're working on it" | No ask, no timeline, no strategic connection |

### What Should Have Happened (With a Story Kit)

**Elevator pitch (30 seconds):**

"Our data pipeline drops 15% of events during peak hours, which means our product analytics are unreliable and we can't trust our A/B test results. We've validated a migration path to [new system] that would give us 99.9% reliability and cut our processing costs by 40%. We need 2 engineers for 8 weeks, and we'd have the first phase live by end of Q2."

**If the CEO wanted more:** The PM could expand on any PRAA component — deeper on the problem (customer impact of unreliable data), the result (what reliable analytics enables), the action (phased migration plan), or the ask (team allocation).

### The Five Reactive Skills Applied

| Skill | How It Would Have Helped |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Prepare** | Having an elevator pitch memorized = instant response |
| **Build Q&A** | Ready answers for "why now?" and "what about vendor X?" |
| **Practice redirect** | After answering the CEO's question, bridging to the strategic value |
| **Eye contact + brevity** | 30-second pitch with direct eye contact signals confidence and clarity |
| **"Let me follow up"** | For deep technical questions: "I can send you the vendor evaluation by Friday" |

### Key Takeaway

Reactive storytelling failures are always preparation failures. The PM knew the story — they just hadn't compressed it into a format that works without slides and preparation time. A story kit (elevator pitch + talking points + Q&A) is a permanent investment that pays off in every unexpected moment.

## Amazon's Memo Culture — Format Shaping Organizational Thinking

### Concept Illustrated: How a format choice can become a strategic advantage when adopted as organizational practice

**Context:** Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoint at Amazon in favor of six-page memos. This wasn't just a format preference — it was a deliberate strategic choice about how the organization should think.

### Why Memos Over Slides

| Dimension | Slides | Memos |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Thinking quality** | Bullet points hide fuzzy thinking — "sounds good" on a slide might be incoherent as prose | Writing forces the author to construct complete arguments — gaps become visible |
| **Audience engagement** | Passive — audience follows the presenter's pace | Active — audience reads at their own pace, engages with details, forms independent opinions |
| **Information density** | Low — 6 words per bullet, 6 bullets per slide | High — complete sentences convey nuance, caveats, and reasoning |
| **Discussion quality** | "What did you mean on slide 7?" — clarification questions dominate | "I disagree with the argument on page 3 because..." — substantive debate |

### The Meeting Format

Amazon meetings start with 15-30 minutes of silent reading. Everyone reads the memo. Then discussion begins. This creates several advantages:
- **No pre-read problem** — people who didn't read the pre-read still engage with the full argument
- **Equal preparation** — everyone starts the discussion at the same information level
- **Author accountability** — the memo must stand on its own; the author can't rescue weak arguments with charisma

### Format × Proactive Mode

| Mode | How It Works in Written Culture |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Pitch | One-page executive summary — PRAA compressed to a single page |
| Pre-Sell | Draft memo shared with key stakeholders for feedback before the formal meeting |
| Inform | Brief written update in established format — concise, factual, outcome-focused |
| Report | Post-launch memo connecting results to the original story — same format, closing the loop |
| Workshop | Written problem statement and options distributed before the collaborative session |

### Key Takeaway

Format choices are not cosmetic — they shape how organizations think, debate, and decide. If your organization is considering a format shift, understand that you're not just changing a medium — you're changing the quality of thinking that medium enables.
