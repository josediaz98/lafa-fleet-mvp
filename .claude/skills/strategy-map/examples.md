# Strategy Map: Real-World Case Studies

Examples demonstrating the 6-Dimension Strategy System in practice. Each case study illustrates specific strategic concepts with real companies.

## The Slack Counterfactual — Cascade Effect in Action

The most powerful demonstration of why Target Audience is the upstream constraint that shapes all other dimensions.

| If Audience = | Problem Becomes | Value Prop Becomes | Differentiation Becomes | Channel Becomes | Monetization Becomes |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Workplace collaboration** | Fast decisions, lower communication cost | Save time by removing barriers | Productivity innovation vs email | Viral + sales | Freemium (message history limit) |
| **Online communities** | Moderation and discovery | Automate painful moderation | Community management/growth | Non-enterprise motion | Ads-based model |

**Lesson:** Audience choice is not a marketing label — it is a **structural decision** that forces strategy coherence across all dimensions. Every other dimension changes when the audience changes.

## LinkedIn Sales Navigator — Bullseye Narrowing

### The Problem: "Salespeople" Is Not a Target Audience

"All salespeople" is an aspiration, not a target audience. It contains materially different jobs:

- **Hunters (Account Executives):** Optimize for prospecting and closing new deals
- **Farmers (Account Managers):** Optimize for expansion and retention

Trying to serve both with equal priority yields a compromised solution that feels generic to both — high effort, low leverage.

### How Narrowing Worked

| Stage | Audience Definition | Strategic Implication |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Broad** | All salespeople | Product tries to serve everyone; no strong PMF signal |
| **Hypothesis** | Hunters vs Farmers — which shows stronger signal? | Hunters showed higher WTP + prospect density |
| **Data-Validated** | B2B hunters doing >$100K ACV in tech/finance | Sharp enough to guide every roadmap tradeoff |

### Key Insight

The bullseye approach treats "target audience" as an **empirical outcome**, not a narrative. Strategy quality improves when you let real customer behavior falsify your initial story.

## Substack — Deep Value Proposition Decomposition

### Surface VP vs Reality

**Surface VP:** "Platform for independent writing"

**Problem with surface:** A team could interpret this as "make writing tools better" and rationally prioritize editor UX, drafting workflows, versioning, collaboration.

**Reality:** The deeper VP is about making *being an independent writer* viable, not making *the act of writing* easier. New independent writers spend ~40% of time on overhead: setting up sites, collecting payments, handling customer service.

### Deep VP (4 Sub-Benefits)

1. **"Get paid"** — monetization mechanics (subscriptions, payments, revenue tools)
2. **"You're in charge"** — audience ownership (email list, direct relationship with readers)
3. **"Start your journey"** — career transition support (from employed journalist to independent)
4. **"Everything you need to make a living writing"** — full stack (no need to cobble together 5 tools)

**Strategic insight:** Surface VPs pull teams toward the most *literal* interpretation (feature work near the noun — "writing" leads to editor improvements), while deep VPs protect the *real mechanism* of value (making a living).

### Substack's Full-Field Competition Map

| Bucket | Competitors | Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | WordPress, Medium, Ghost | "Better publishing platform" = feature race (low leverage) |
| **Indirect** | NYT, WSJ (traditional media) | Different career/identity model — Substack offers independence vs institutional stability |
| **Adjacent** | Patreon, Gumroad (creator monetization) | Overlapping economics, different positioning — Substack bundles writing + business |

**Strategic Move:** Rather than "better editor," Substack bundled a holistic offering around the identity and economics of independent writing (health insurance, legal support, salary advances). This created differentiation that:
- Direct/adjacent competitors are structurally unlikely to match (business models don't support it)
- Traditional publishers are culturally/business-model unlikely to offer (audience ownership)

### Target Audience Narrowing

| Initial Hypothesis | Data Outcome | Narrowed To |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Writers broadly | Professional cadence writers had strongest monetization | Professional journalists transitioning to independent careers |

## Figma — Sub-Benefits from Tagline

### Decomposing "Teams Design Together"

**Tagline:** "Teams design together... from start to finish"

This sounds simple, but the sub-benefits narrow the interpretation space and create strategic clarity:

| Sub-Benefit | What It Entails | Product Implication |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Brainstorming/workshopping** | FigJam — collaborative ideation before design | Invest in non-design collaboration tools |
| **Working cross-functionally** | Non-designers can participate without silos | Reduce barriers for non-design roles |
| **Testing and gathering feedback** | Prototyping and hand-off loop | Build review/annotation features, not just design tools |
| **Establishing shared language** | Libraries and design systems | Design system management is a core product pillar |

**Lesson:** Each sub-benefit is a **value claim** that forces clarity about what "together" and "start to finish" actually entail. Without decomposition, teams might optimize only for the design tool itself, missing the collaborative and organizational dimensions.

### Differentiation

**Value Proposition vs Differentiation distinction:**

| Concept | Figma Example |
|---------|---------------|
| **Value Proposition** | "A way for teams to design together from start to finish" |
| **Strategic Differentiation** | Browser-based real-time collaboration creates network effects — the more people in the org who use Figma, the more valuable it becomes. Competitors would need to rebuild their entire architecture to match. |

## Candy Crush — Viral Utility Pattern

### Product-Channel Fit: Virality Through Functional Value

Candy Crush demonstrates the principle that the invite should make the product **better for the inviter**, not just the invitee.

**Mechanism:** The "lives" constraint turns your network into functional value:
- More friends = fewer waits (you can request and receive lives)
- Inviting is not marketing — it is **utility**

**Pattern:** Viral utility means the social graph is woven into the core mechanic of the product, not bolted on as a "share with friends" button.

---

## Pinterest — Content Inventory Pattern

### Product-Channel Fit: Content as Distribution Engine

Pinterest demonstrates the content loop where usage reliably produces indexable assets at scale.

**Mechanism:** Multi-surface "pin" flows:
- Browser extension for saving from any website
- iOS share sheet for mobile saving
- Content creation embedded into existing user behavior with minimal disruption

**Mental Model:** Treat content like inventory. Prioritize features that increase:
- **Inventory velocity** — more content per user per time
- **Indexability** — better distribution efficiency (SEO, search discovery)

**Loop:**
```
Users sign up -> Users pin content -> Pins distribute via Google/social -> Visitors discover pins -> Some convert -> More content created -> Loop compounds
```

**Lesson:** Pinterest's growth didn't come from "marketing content" — it came from making the product itself a content production system where every user action created a discoverable asset.

## Supercell — Paid Speed-to-Value Pattern

### Product-Channel Fit: First Session as Retention Instrument

Supercell (Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars) demonstrates the paid acquisition pattern where extreme speed-to-value overcomes low intent.

**Challenge:** Paid users arrive with low intent — they clicked an ad, not a recommendation. The product must manufacture engagement quickly or CAC becomes unrecoverable.

**Pattern:**
- Optimized onboarding and "time to first full game" so users experience a complete loop within minutes
- First session designed as a **retention instrument**, not a tutorial
- The experience of one complete cycle (build, attack, reward) hooks before rational evaluation kicks in

**Principle:** Paid growth is often limited by Day 0/Day 1 activation more than by ad creative. The product itself is the conversion mechanism.

## Notejoy — Audience Pivot Through Data

### When Data Falsifies Your Hypothesis

| Stage | Audience Hypothesis | What Happened |
|-------|--------------------|-|
| **Initial** | Small tech companies | Built for tech-savvy teams |
| **Data Signal** | Tech teams undervalued simplicity; didn't retain well | PMF signals weak in target segment |
| **Pivoted To** | Less tech-savvy SMBs (agencies, law firms) | These users valued simplicity as a *feature*, not a limitation |

**Lesson:** Sachin Rekhi (founder) let data override the narrative. The segment where the product won hardest was not the segment the team had assumed — it was a group that valued the product's constraints as benefits.

---

## Workday — Sales-Led Product-Channel Fit

### Balancing Buyer vs End User

Sales-led products face a structural tension: features that close deals are not always features that drive daily adoption.

**Workday's Pattern:**
- **Buyer-grade:** Reporting, compliance, audit trails, procurement fit — these satisfy the decision-maker
- **End-user-grade:** Workflow manageability, usable interface — these drive daily adoption and reduce churn

**Implication:** The best sales-led products intentionally resolve this tension through role-based experiences. If you only optimize for the buyer, you win the deal but lose the account. If you only optimize for the end user, you never get in the door.

---

## HubSpot — The "80% Product" Mid-Market Pattern

### Comprehensive Base + Gated Customization

At Mid-Market ARPPU (~$10K), you can support light-touch inside sales, but product still drives growth.

**HubSpot's Approach:**
- Broad base product comprehensive for most use cases — wins by solving the majority of needs cleanly
- Advanced customization (custom objects, deeper integrations) gated to higher plans
- Resists deep one-off customization that bloats product and slows iteration

**The "80% Product" Concept:** Win by solving 80% of use cases cleanly while resisting the remaining 20% that would create enterprise-grade complexity at mid-market pricing.

---

## TripAdvisor — Structural Product-Channel Fit

### Shaping the Product to Amplify the Content Loop

TripAdvisor realized growth came from user-generated content discovered through Google. Rather than just optimizing SEO:

**Structural Change:** Shaped product incentives (points, badges, recognition) to amplify contribution volume and quality.

**Compounding Loop:**
```
Users contribute reviews -> Reviews indexed by Google -> Travelers discover TripAdvisor -> Some contribute reviews -> Loop compounds
```

**Key Distinction:** This was not "incremental conversion optimization" — it was fundamentally molding product development around channel mechanics (product-channel fit).

---

## Mailchimp — SMB Discoverability + Love

### Self-Serve as Strategy

At SMB scale (~$1K ARPPU, ~100K payers needed), customers actively search and compare. You can't economically support high-touch sales.

**Mailchimp's Pattern:**
- Intuitive UX + trialability that lets adoption do the selling
- Free-to-paid trials with crisp "aha" moment
- NPS drives word-of-mouth and review velocity — NPS becomes a growth input, not a vanity metric

**Product-Model Fit:** Self-serve enough that customers convince themselves.
