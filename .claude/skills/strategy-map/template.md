- **Key narrowing attributes:**
  - Use Case: [Why this segment gets the most value]
  - Role: [Organizational function or user type]
  - Demographics: [Relevant demographic characteristics]
  - Firmographics: [Industry, company size, budget if B2B]

## 2. Problem

**Outcome-Motivation-Gap Analysis:**

- **Outcome:** [The end state users truly want — not a task, not a feature]
- **Motivation:** [Why the outcome matters — fear, desire, status, identity]
- **Gap:** [Where current solutions fail given real constraints]

**Current alternatives and their failure points:**

| Alternative | What It Offers | Where It Fails |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| [Alternative 1] | [Value provided] | [Specific gap] |
| [Alternative 2] | [Value provided] | [Specific gap] |
| [Status quo / manual process] | [Value provided] | [Specific gap] |

## 3. Value Proposition

**Surface VP:** [High-level tagline or positioning statement]

**Deep VP (Sub-Benefits Stack):**

| # | Sub-Benefit | Layer | Evidence/Proof | Under-delivered? |
|---|------------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | [Specific benefit promise] | [Functional / Emotional / Social] | [Data or user signal] | [Yes/No] |
| 2 | [Specific benefit promise] | [Functional / Emotional / Social] | [Data or user signal] | [Yes/No] |
| 3 | [Specific benefit promise] | [Functional / Emotional / Social] | [Data or user signal] | [Yes/No] |
| 4 | [Specific benefit promise] | [Functional / Emotional / Social] | [Data or user signal] | [Yes/No] |
| 5 | [Specific benefit promise] | [Functional / Emotional / Social] | [Data or user signal] | [Yes/No] |

**Quarterly test:** "If we ship nothing else this quarter, what must we improve to still be true to our promise?"

## 4. Strategic Differentiation

**Full-Field Competition Map:**

| Bucket | Competitor | Why Users Choose Them | Implication for Us |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Direct | [Competitor 1] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [What this means for our strategy] |
| Direct | [Competitor 2] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [What this means for our strategy] |
| Indirect | [Alternative 1] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [What this means for our strategy] |
| Indirect | [Alternative 2] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [What this means for our strategy] |
| Adjacent | [Product 1] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [Expansion threat or opportunity] |
| Adjacent | [Product 2] | [Top 2-3 reasons] | [Expansion threat or opportunity] |

**Unique Attributes (hard to copy):**

| # | Attribute | Mechanism (why hard to copy) | Compounding? |
|---|----------|------------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | [Unique attribute] | [Structural reason competitors can't replicate] | [Yes/No — does it get stronger over time?] |
| 2 | [Unique attribute] | [Structural reason competitors can't replicate] | [Yes/No] |
| 3 | [Unique attribute] | [Structural reason competitors can't replicate] | [Yes/No] |

## 5. Channel Strategy

**Dominant Acquisition Loop:** [Viral / Content / Paid / Sales]

**Loop Mechanics:**
```
[Step 1] -> [Step 2] -> [Step 3] -> Loop repeats
```

**Current Constraint:** [The single bottleneck limiting loop throughput]

**Product-Channel Fit Assessment:**

| Aspect | Current State | Ideal State |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Is the product shaped to the channel? | [Description] | [What it should look like] |
| Incremental or structural opportunity? | [Incremental / Structural] | [Recommendation] |
| Key conversion variable | [Metric] | [Target] |

**Product patterns for [channel type]:**
- [Specific pattern relevant to the dominant loop]
- [How the product should be shaped to increase loop throughput]

---

## 6. Monetization

**Company Type:** [Mass Market (~$10 ARPPU) / Prosumer (~$100) / SMB (~$1K) / Mid-Market (~$10K) / Enterprise (~$100K)]

**Monetization Model:**

| Component | Current | Assessment |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Scale** (value metric) | [How price scales with value] | [Aligned / Misaligned — why] |
| **What** (paid features) | [What customers pay for] | [Creates conversion pressure? Yes/No] |
| **Amount** (price point) | [Price] | [Consistent with company type?] |
| **When** (charging event) | [Billing cadence] | [Matches time-to-value?] |

**Product-Model Fit:**
- [How the product is or isn't shaped to the pricing logic]
- [Does the dominant acquisition lever match the company type?]

## Cascade Analysis

**System Coherence Check:**

| Connection | Coherent? | Tension |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Audience -> Problem | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |
| Problem -> Value Prop | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |
| Value Prop -> Differentiation | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |
| Differentiation -> Channels | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |
| Channels -> Monetization | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |
| Audience -> Monetization (end-to-end) | [Yes/No] | [Description of any misalignment] |

**If audience changed to [alternative segment], what would cascade?**
- Problem becomes: [...]
- VP becomes: [...]
- Differentiation becomes: [...]
- Channel becomes: [...]
- Monetization becomes: [...]
