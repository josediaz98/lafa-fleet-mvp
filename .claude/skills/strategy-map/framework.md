# Product Strategy Map: The Six-Dimensional System

Product strategy is the act of **choosing what to be great at for a specific user, in a specific context, through specific distribution and economic mechanics**. It is not a vision statement plus a roadmap — it is a system of six interlocking choices.

The fundamental shift from "good PM" to "great PM" strategy work is moving from **surface understanding** to **deep understanding**: choices that are narrow, defensible, measurable, and mutually reinforcing.

---

## The 6D Strategy System Overview

| Dimension | Surface Understanding | Deep Understanding |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Target Audience** | "Our users are X" | The **narrowest relevant user** and why; can defend exclusion |
| **Problem** | "We solve pain point Y" | The **true outcome** users want, driven by motivation, blocked by gaps |
| **Value Proposition** | One high-level tagline | A **portfolio of sub-benefits** with explicit priority and proof |
| **Differentiation** | Benchmarks direct competitors | Competes vs **full field**: direct, indirect, adjacent |
| **Channel Strategy** | Optimizes conversion rates | Engineers **product-channel fit** (product shaped to channel mechanics) |
| **Monetization** | "We'll charge $X" | Engineers **product-model fit** (product shaped to pricing logic) |

### Summary Table

| Dimension | Key Question | Framework | Output Artifact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Target Audience** | Who do we win hardest for? | Bullseye Approach | ICP doc, attribute rubric, disqualifiers |
| **Problem** | What outcome do they truly want? | Outcome-Motivation-Gap | Outcome statement, motivation map, gap inventory |
| **Value Proposition** | What do we promise to deliver? | Sub-Benefits Stack | Benefit ladder, proof points, feature-to-benefit traceability |
| **Differentiation** | Why do we keep winning? | Full-Field Competition Map | Competitive field map, wedge thesis, moat narrative |
| **Channels** | How does distribution compound? | Product-Channel Fit | Growth model, key conversion variables, product patterns by channel |
| **Monetization** | How does revenue align with value? | Product-Model Fit | Pricing metric, packaging, upgrade triggers, unit economics |

---

## The Cascade Effect

The key dynamic is **dependency**: Target Audience sits at the start because it constrains the feasible and optimal choices for the remaining five dimensions. In practice, PMs often treat these as separate checkboxes, but they must be treated as a **coupled system**.

Change who you are building for, and you necessarily change the problems worth solving, the value propositions that resonate, the differentiation game you can win, the channels that work, and the monetization model that is viable.

**Audience choice is not a marketing label — it is a structural decision that forces strategy coherence across all dimensions.**

---

## Dimension 1: Target Audience — The Bullseye Approach

### Why "Everyone" Creates Unfocused Products

Defining your target audience as your total addressable audience leads to unfocused product development. When you build for a broad, heterogeneous group, you dilute the product's ability to deeply satisfy any one subgroup's needs — weakening product-market fit, retention, and organic growth.

### The Bullseye Approach (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Define Broadest Addressable Audience**
Everyone who *could* get value from the product over time. This is TAM thinking applied to population, not dollars.

**Step 2: Narrow Through Concentric Rings (Hypothesis)**
Which segments are you logically poised to serve best given your product's inherent strengths and constraints? Progressively reduce entropy until the audience definition is sharp enough to guide roadmap tradeoffs.

**Step 3: Confirm and Refine with Live Data (Validation)**
Validate which segments are actually most attractive and responsive. Either refine narrower than expected or pivot to a different segment than assumed.

**Key Insight:** The bullseye approach treats "target audience" as an **empirical outcome**, not a narrative.

### The Five Attribute Filters for Narrowing

| Attribute | What It Isolates | Best For |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Use Case** | *Why* the user gets value, what job they are hiring for | First filter — sharpest |
| **Role** | Organizational function, workflows, permissions, success metrics | B2B clarity |
| **Demographics** | Age, location, etc. | Often weaker in B2B than behavior |
| **Firmographics** | Industry, company size, budget, procurement, compliance | B2B dynamics |
| **Psychographics** | Adoption propensity, simplicity vs power preference, change appetite | Adoption speed |

**Sequencing Tip:** Start with use case and role, then firmographics, then psychographics — these directly affect buying and retention.

### Validation Signals

**PMF Signals:** High retention, meaningfully positive NPS, significant organic traffic. You don't need all at once, but you need *enough signal*.

**Segment Attractiveness Scorecard:**
- Segment size
- Resonance with value proposition
- Willingness to pay
- Strongest delivered value (engagement/happiness)
- Channel reachability
- Strategic fit with longer-term vision

**Critical Insight:** A smaller segment that is easy to reach, pays reliably, and retains strongly can be the right wedge — especially early — because it compounds into distribution, referrals, and learning velocity.

### Critical Nuance: Prioritization Policy, Not Exclusion Policy

Narrowing your target audience does **not** mean turning away everyone else. It means you prioritize product decisions for the subgroup where you win hardest. You can still accept adjacent users, but they should not dominate the roadmap unless they become the data-backed bullseye later.

### Key Questions

- Who do you win *hardest* for? (not just "who uses it")
- Who are you explicitly NOT optimizing for?
- Can you defend the exclusion with data?

### Pros

- Creates a **hard roadmap filter** that reduces wasted "maybe valuable" work
- Improves odds of **strong PMF** by concentrating effort
- Makes strategy legible: you can explain *why* you are saying no without hand-waving
- Enables compounding: higher retention -> more referrals -> cheaper acquisition -> faster iteration

### Failure Modes

- Can overfit to early adopters and miss mainstream if treated as permanent
- Narrowing based on intuition (step 2) becomes "founder storytelling" unless step 3 is genuinely data-driven
- Teams sometimes pick segments easy to sell to rather than strategically defensible
- If your org worships TAM, expect political pushback unless you show a wedge-to-expansion path

## Dimension 2: Problem — The Outcome-Motivation-Gap (OMG) Framework

### The "Faster Horses" Trap

PMs can usually articulate the explicit challenge ("users struggle with X") and explain how the product addresses it, but they miss the **final outcome** users are truly after. This leads to shipping "better versions of the current thing" rather than step-change solutions.

### Framework: Outcome-Motivation-Gap (OMG)

**Outcome:** The end state the user wants (not the task, not the feature). Outcomes are stable while implementations change.

**Motivation:** Why the outcome matters — what fear, desire, status, or identity is attached. This reveals the emotional stakes.

**Gap:** Where the user's current stack fails to deliver the outcome given real constraints (time, trust, cognitive load, compliance, coordination).

### Why This Matters

If you anchor on outcomes, your roadmap becomes **resilient to competitor features and tech shifts**. If you anchor on surface problems, you get feature-churn.

### Key Questions

- What outcome do users truly want? (not what feature they ask for)
- Why does this outcome matter to them emotionally/professionally?
- Where exactly do current alternatives fail?
- If you anchor on outcomes, does your roadmap become resilient to competitor features?

### Pros

- Creates non-obvious product direction
- Clarifies what "success" means
- Makes user research actionable

### Failure Modes

- Teams can get lost in abstraction ("the outcome is happiness") unless you operationalize into measurable proxies and concrete constraints

## Dimension 3: Value Proposition — The Sub-Benefits Stack

### The Compression Problem

A high-level value proposition is like compressing the Mona Lisa into a tiny file — it loses detail. That loss is "fine" only if everyone has seen the original. But new team members fill in missing detail with assumptions. Those assumptions diverge.

**Hidden Cost:** A vague VP doesn't just confuse messaging — it **degrades execution quality** and **dilutes the roadmap**.

### Surface VP vs Deep VP

| Type | What It Is | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Surface VP** | Single statement gesturing at value | Tells you the *category*, not the *commitments* |
| **Deep VP** | Set of 3-5 sub-benefits | Pins down real, testable "why users choose us" units |

**The Test:** Deep VP lets you answer without hand-waving: "If we ship nothing else this quarter, what must we improve to still be true to our promise?"

### Sub-Benefits: The Unit of Alignment

Sub-benefits do two strategic jobs:

1. **Make delivered value legible.** Instead of debating what the high-level VP "really means," you debate whether sub-benefit #2 is being strengthened or neglected.

2. **Enable precise measurement.** Sub-benefits let you define progress per component, lowering the chance you over-invest in one area while silently under-delivering on another.

**Third effect:** Sub-benefits create a built-in completeness check — your roadmap can be audited against the whole VP, not just the easiest slice.

### Sub-Benefit Layers

Structure sub-benefits into three layers:

- **Functional:** Speed, accuracy, cost
- **Emotional:** Confidence, relief
- **Social/Status:** Professionalism, legitimacy

Great products often win because of a non-obvious emotional or social sub-benefit, even when functional parity exists.

### The "Ideal Homepage" Discovery Method

Imagine your ideal homepage — homepages are forced to be a distillation of value + differentiation that persuades action.

**Structure:**
- High-level tagline (surface VP)
- 3-5 benefit statements (sub-benefits)

**Bottoms-up approach:** Enumerate every benefit, cluster into themes, prioritize themes that (a) map to what most resonated with users and (b) carry your differentiation.

### Anti-Pattern: Feature Laundry Lists

Teams brainstorm "benefits" but end up listing features. That shrinks strategy into an incremental backlog.

**Correction:** Repeatedly ask "What does this feature *do for the user*?" Legal support is not a sub-benefit; "everything you need to make a living writing" is.

### Key Questions

- What are the 3-5 specific things you promise to deliver?
- For each sub-benefit: does it change what you would build next? (If not, it is not doing strategic work)
- Are sub-benefits functional, emotional, or social/status?
- Which sub-benefit is most under-delivered?

### Rule

If a sub-benefit doesn't change what you would build next, it's not doing strategic work.

### Pros

- Sharply reduces misalignment
- Makes prioritization auditable
- Produces clearer differentiation

### Failure Modes

- Can create false precision if treated as static "requirements" rather than evolving hypotheses
- Can tempt teams to pick 8-12 sub-benefits, recreating vagueness through breadth

## Dimension 4: Strategic Differentiation — The Full Field of Competition

### Differentiation vs Value Proposition

| Concept | What It Answers |
|---------|----------------|
| **Value Proposition** | "What solution do we provide, for whom, and why valuable?" |
| **Strategic Differentiation** | "Why does this value stay compelling when others copy the surface?" |

Differentiation is the **defensibility mechanism** behind your value proposition. Competitors can copy UI, workflows, and parts of the product — but recreating the underlying system is meaningfully harder.

### The Full Field of Competition (3 Buckets)

Most PMs only benchmark direct competitors. The trap: users don't experience your product category — they experience a **job to be done** with multiple viable solutions.

| Bucket | Definition | Strategic Value |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Direct Competitors** | Category peers with closest value proposition | Parity and table-stakes (least interesting for durable differentiation) |
| **Indirect Alternatives** | "Different category, same job" — what customers do if your category didn't exist | Reveals *real* decision criteria and trade-offs users accept |
| **Adjacent Markets** | Products touching user journey before/after, or solving neighboring sub-problems | Where expansion threats come from; "they added our core feature" moment |

**Heuristic for Indirect:** Ask customers "How would you solve this without us?" Treat the answer as your true competitive set.

**Heuristic for Adjacent:** Map the end-to-end user journey. Adjacency is defined by workflow proximity, not feature similarity.

### The 2-Step Process

**Step 1: Define Your Full Field of Competition**
Output: A *choice model*, not a competitor list. Articulate the top 2-3 reasons a user chooses each alternative.

**Step 2: Identify Unique Attributes (Beyond Features)**
Unique attributes can include:
- Proprietary IP
- Exceptional talent density
- Data advantages
- Business model that funds subsidies
- Supply advantage
- Distribution
- Ecosystem you can orchestrate

**Critical Test:** Not "is it unique today" but "is it *hard to copy* given competitors' incentives and constraints?"

**If you can't explain the mechanism that makes it hard to copy, you don't have differentiation — you have a claim.**

### Operationalizing Differentiation

Every major investment should either:
- (a) Reinforce the differentiator
- (b) Protect it against adjacent encroachment
- (c) Unlock a compounding loop that makes the differentiator stronger next quarter

If an initiative doesn't do one of those, it might still be useful, but it's not strategic — fund it accordingly.

**Maintain Two Maps:**
1. **Choice map:** Full field (direct/indirect/adjacent)
2. **Attributes map:** Top 3-5 unique attributes and the mechanism that makes each hard to copy

### Key Questions

- What are the top 2-3 reasons a user chooses each alternative?
- What unique attributes do you have that are **hard to copy**?
- Does each major investment reinforce, protect, or compound your differentiator?

### Pros

- Forces competition on dimensions that actually drive adoption
- Helps avoid local maxima (winning feature parity wars while losing the broader job)
- Makes adjacent-market risk explicit early

### Failure Modes

- Can become excuse for strategy sprawl (if everything is competition, nothing is)
- Can over-rotate into non-product advantages that don't scale or compound

**Discipline:** Pick differentiators that either compound over time (data loops, ecosystem depth) or create durable constraints for others (audience ownership, switching costs, distribution lock-in).

---

## Dimension 5: Channel Strategy — Product-Channel Fit

### Beyond "What Channel Works"

Most PMs can name the channel driving growth, but fewer can explain the **loop mechanics** that make it compound, and even fewer can reshape the product to increase loop throughput.

**Key Shift:** Treat each channel as a **closed-loop system** with explicit conversion steps. Your job is not just to "improve conversion" but to identify the loop's constraint and decide whether to pursue local improvements (incremental) or structural changes (fundamental fit).

### The Four Acquisition Loops

#### Viral Loop
```
User signs up via invite -> Some users invite others -> Some invitees convert -> Loop repeats
```
**Engine:** Social propagation and user's willingness to invite.

**Key Insight:** Virality is not "a referral feature" — it is a *behavioral outcome* driven by perceived value, social utility, and low-friction invites.

#### Content Loop
```
Users sign up -> Content created -> Content distributes via search/social -> Visitors convert -> Loop repeats
```
**Engine:** Content production and distribution efficiency.

**Key Insight:** Not "write blog posts." It is designing a system where usage reliably produces indexable/discoverable assets at scale.

#### Paid Loop
```
Users sign up via ads -> Some convert to paying -> Revenue funds more ads -> Loop repeats
```
**Engine:** Unit economics and rapid conversion/retention under low intent.

**Hard Truth:** Paid users often have low intent, so your product must manufacture engagement quickly or CAC becomes unrecoverable.

#### Sales Loop
```
Customers sign -> Revenue funds more sales capacity -> Reps convert more leads -> Loop repeats
```
**Engine:** Organizational capacity + product that supports multi-persona requirements.

Often paired with a separate lead-gen loop (e.g., content feeding sales).

### Incremental Optimization vs Product-Channel Fit

| Mode | What It Is | When It Works | Limitation |
|------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Incremental** | Identify key conversion variables and make measurable improvements | Loop already working, you are scaling | Local maxima — polishing funnel while ignoring structural changes |
| **Product-Channel Fit** | Fundamentally mold product development around channel mechanics | Need step-change growth | Higher bet size, can misfire if you misdiagnose dominant channel |

### Product Patterns by Channel Type

#### Virality: Increase Network Effects + Reduce Time-to-Value

Virality requires users to reach meaningful value quickly and have a reason to bring others in.

**Principle:** The invite should make the product better for the inviter, not just the invitee.

#### Content: Make Content Creation Frictionless + Indexable

If content fuels acquisition, content creation is your production line.

**Mental Model:** Treat content like inventory. Prioritize features that increase **inventory velocity** (more content per user per time) and **indexability** (better distribution efficiency).

#### Paid: Extreme Speed to Value Under Low Intent

**Principle:** Design the first session as a retention instrument, not a tutorial. Paid growth is often limited by Day 0/Day 1 activation more than by ad creative.

#### Sales: Balance Multiple Personas (Buyer vs End User)

Sales-led products win deals by satisfying buyer requirements (compliance, reporting, procurement fit), but retain accounts by supporting end-user usability.

**Implication:** Features that close deals are not always features that drive daily adoption. The best sales-led products intentionally resolve this tension through role-based experiences.

### Channel Pros and Cons

| Channel | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Viral** | Scales cheaply; compounding loop; defensible via network effects | Hard to "turn on"; caps due to network saturation; invites can degrade brand |
| **Content** | Durable compounding (SEO); high trust; owned distribution asset | Slow ramp; sensitive to platform changes; quality control becomes ops problem |
| **Paid** | Fast feedback; predictable scaling when economics work; good for testing positioning | Unforgiving economics; low intent stresses activation; becomes "arms race" |
| **Sales** | High ACV potential; penetrates regulated/complex markets; structured learning | Long cycles; heavy process overhead; must satisfy multiple personas; scaling = org buildout |

### The "Loop Constraint" Method

1. Map your dominant loop in three steps
2. Identify the single constraint that limits throughput (the "narrowest pipe")
3. Decide whether to fix it incrementally or structurally via product-channel fit

**Most teams should pick one dominant loop to obsess over.** Multi-channel strategies often become "multi-unowned," where no loop compounds meaningfully.

---

## Dimension 6: Monetization Strategy — Product-Model Fit

### Beyond "Pricing"

Most teams can recite their monetization model — that is table-stakes. The real strategic work is aligning what you build with the **physics implied by your revenue model**.

**Core Insight:** Monetization strategy is not "pick a price." It is "design the product so that the path to revenue is the natural path of product success."

### The 4 Components of a Monetization Model

| Component | What It Specifies | Strategic Risk |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Scale** | Value metric — how price increases as delivered value increases | Metric too decoupled from value (users resent it) or too easy to bypass (leak revenue) |
| **What** | What customers pay for (features, limits, permissions, support, etc.) | Tiers don't create conversion pressure |
| **Amount** | Price point | Amount is downstream of whether Scale and What are coherent |
| **When** | Charging event (never, monthly, annual, per transaction, etc.) | Shapes incentives and product cadence |

**"When" matters:** Annual contracts tolerate longer time-to-value but demand stronger proof. Transactional models demand every unit of usage feels worth paying for.

### Product-Model Fit by Company Type

The Chris Janz model classifies companies by ARPPU x needed paying customers to reach ~$100M:

| Type | ARPPU | Payers Needed | Dominant Acquisition Lever | Product-Model Fit Pattern |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mass Market** | ~$10 | ~10M | Virality or content scale | Reduce friction, amplify sharing/creation, ruthless time-to-value |
| **Prosumer** | ~$100 | ~1M | Casual contact virality | Product outputs seen by non-users naturally |
| **SMB** | ~$1K | ~100K | Discoverability + NPS | Self-serve, crisp "aha" moment, free-to-paid trials |
| **Mid-Market** | ~$10K | ~10K | 80% product + light inside sales | Comprehensive base + advanced customization gated to higher tiers |
| **Enterprise** | ~$100K | ~1K | Depth and configurability | APIs, permissions, audit logs, extensibility, services/partners |

### Detailed Patterns by Company Type

#### Mass Market: Win via Virality or Content Scale
When you need ~10M paying users, you are playing a scale game. Improve network effects and/or make content creation dramatically easier so the product can "self-distribute."

**Warning:** "More features" often hurts because it slows time-to-value and increases cognitive load.

#### Prosumer: Engineer Casual Contact Virality
Still a viral game, but can win with lower viral coefficient (only need ~1M payers). Product seen by non-users in natural course of use.

**Trade-off:** Casual virality can conflict with premium positioning. Want exposure without feeling spammy or cheap.

#### SMB: Be Discoverable + Be Loved
At ~$1K ARPPU with ~100K payers, customers actively search and compare. NPS stops being vanity and becomes a growth input — it drives word-of-mouth and review velocity.

**Product-Model Fit:** Self-serve enough that customers convince themselves. Free-to-paid trials and crisp "aha" moment matter because you can't economically support high-touch sales.

#### Mid-Market: Build an "80% Product"
Can support light-touch inside sales, but product still drives growth. Win by solving majority use cases cleanly while resisting deep one-off customization that bloats product and slows iteration.

#### Enterprise: Compete on Depth and Configurability
Win on "depth of solution" and ability to adapt to each account's workflows. Expand configurability, integrations, administration, compliance, implementation pathways.

**Nuance:** Enterprise "customizability" isn't only UI toggles. It is a full platform surface — APIs, permissions, audit logs, data models, extensibility — plus services/partners.

### Tier Pros and Cons

| Tier | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Mass Market** | Enormous upside; winner-take-most with network effects; efficient CAC at scale | Brutal distribution requirements; tiny pricing mistakes fatal; complexity kills growth |
| **Prosumer** | Premium pricing with consumer-like distribution; brand-driven moats; strong LTV | Hard to balance premium with viral; narrower TAM; churn risk if switching costs low |
| **SMB** | Customers actively search; clearer ROI narratives; fast sales cycles; scalable with self-serve | Highly competitive; NPS must stay high; support burden can explode; pricing power capped |
| **Mid-Market** | Higher ARPPU supports better margins; can add inside sales; tiered packaging works | Temptation to over-customize; longer onboarding; requires sharper segmentation |
| **Enterprise** | Big contracts; stickiness via integrations; expansion revenue; defensibility through depth | Slow sales cycles; implementation risk; roadmap capture by large accounts |

### Practical Decision Points

1. **ARPPU tier is a declaration**, not just pricing. If your org says "we're SMB" but roadmap decisions look enterprise or mass-market, you get strategy incoherence.

2. **Product-model fit is about compounding.** Prioritize features that strengthen the dominant lever for your tier, not "features customers requested" in the abstract.

3. **"When you charge" must match time-to-value.** If your product needs weeks of setup, monthly self-serve may create churn pressure; annual or implementation-backed packaging may be more honest.

### Often Overlooked Monetization Moves

- **Price discrimination via packaging:** Different segments pay for different value
- **Hybrid monetization:** Base subscription + usage
- **"Paid unlocks" at moments of realized value** (not moments of need)
- **Designing "outputs" as distribution surfaces** (prosumer)
- **Designing "administration" as monetization surfaces** (mid-market/enterprise) — admin features are often the cleanest WTP drivers because they attach to organizational risk and control

---

## The Meta-Lesson: Deep Strategy Creates Roadmap Leverage

### Needle-Moving vs Incremental Work

Incremental features feel productive because they ship, but they often don't improve the strategic system.

**Needle-moving work** sharpens one or more strategy dimensions in a way that increases compounding returns:
- Better targeting
- Stronger loops
- Clearer value
- Stronger moat
- Cheaper acquisition
- Higher monetization efficiency

### The Highest-Leverage PM Behavior

The highest-leverage PM behavior is **not prioritizing harder** — it is **preventing the team from building for the wrong user**.

**Operationalize this into two artifacts:**

1. **Feature Prioritization Policy:** Which requests are on-strategy and deserve disproportionate investment
2. **Deprioritization Policy:** Which requests are off-strategy (or require modification)

### Continuous Validation

Treat validation as a **continuous system**, not a one-off exercise. Your target audience is a living hypothesis that becomes stronger or weaker as signals shift.

If you don't instrument retention, activation, and segment-level engagement, you will drift back into surface-level strategy and roadmap-by-opinion.
