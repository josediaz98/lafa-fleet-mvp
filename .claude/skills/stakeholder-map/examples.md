## GoDaddy Partners — Pre-Sell Cascade with Leadership

### Concept Illustrated: How pre-selling key leaders in sequence transforms a risky group pitch into a ratification

**Context:** GoDaddy's PM team proposed a unified partners platform — a major strategic investment requiring alignment from 5+ senior leaders across product, engineering, partnerships, and finance. The initiative would require a dedicated team for 18+ months.

### The Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Type | DACI | What PM Needed | Initial Stance |
|------------|------|------|----------------|---------------|
| VP Product | Leadership | Approver | Budget + headcount approval | Neutral — supportive of partner growth but unsure about this approach |
| VP Engineering | Leadership | Approver | Engineering team allocation | Opposed — concerned about technical complexity of unification |
| Head of Partnerships | Leadership | Informed → Contributor | Domain expertise + partner data | Supportive — had been asking for better partner tools |
| CFO | Leadership | Approver | Budget sign-off | Neutral — needed ROI justification |
| Direct Manager | Leadership | Approver | Air cover + advocacy | Supportive — had championed the exploration |

### Pre-Sell Strategy

**Sequencing logic:** Start with the strongest supporter to build momentum, then use each conversation's intelligence to prepare for the next.

| Order | Stakeholder | Method | Why This Method | What PM Learned |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1st | Head of Partnerships | Feedback | Already supportive; their feedback strengthened the customer evidence | Partner churn data the PM didn't have — 40% cite tool fragmentation |
| 2nd | Direct Manager | Advice | High trust; needed coaching on how to pitch to VP Product | VP Product was recently burned by a long-running platform project — need to show quick wins |
| 3rd | VP Product | Feedback | Neutral + high importance = need their input to shape the approach | Wanted to see phased milestones, not a monolithic 18-month plan |
| 4th | VP Engineering | Co-creation | Opposed + high importance = needed to participate in the technical approach | Once involved in the architecture discussion, shifted from opponent to co-owner |
| 5th | CFO | Pre-read | Neutral + lower direct involvement = needed exposure, not engagement | No surprises — financial model was reviewed before the meeting |

### The Result

By the time the formal leadership review happened, every leader in the room had already seen the story, raised their objections privately, and seen their feedback reflected. The meeting was a 20-minute ratification, not a 90-minute debate.

**Key takeaway:** The VP Engineering — originally opposed — became one of the strongest advocates in the meeting because the co-creation session made the technical approach partly his idea.

## GoDaddy Pro Team — Inception Workshop for Team Alignment

### Concept Illustrated: How asking the team HOW they want to be engaged produces better outcomes than assuming

**Context:** After securing leadership alignment on the GoDaddy Pro strategy, the PM needed to motivate and align a newly assembled team. The team had no prior context on the story, the partners, or the strategy.

### 5-Dimension Diagnostic

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Context | New team — excited but uncertain about direction |
| Goals | Wanting to deliver impact and build reputation as a high-performing team |
| Relationship to Story | Invisible — zero awareness of the initiative |
| Relationship to PM | New — no established trust, limited working history |
| Communication Style | Unknown — the PM hadn't worked with this team before |

### The Decision: Ask, Don't Assume

Rather than defaulting to a presentation ("here's what we're building"), the PM asked the team how they wanted to engage with the strategy. The team chose a **3-day workshop**.

### The Inception

| Day | Activities | Outcome |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Day 1 | Sponsors Overview (full story), Sliders exercise, Scoping | Team understood the WHY and agreed on success parameters |
| Day 2 | Anchors & Engines, Epics definition by function, cross-functional sharing | Risks surfaced early; team felt heard about concerns |
| Day 3 | Stories breakdown, Milestones planning, Sponsors Readout, Next Steps | Shared plan that the team felt ownership of |

### Why This Worked

The inception transformed the team from mercenaries (executing someone else's plan) into missionaries (executing *their* plan). Three specific mechanisms:

1. **Processing time** — The team had 3 days to internalize the story, not 30 minutes
2. **Participation** — Writing their own epics and stories created ownership
3. **Risk surfacing** — The Anchors & Engines exercise let the team voice concerns before execution, not during

**Ownership gradient in action:** A presentation (low ownership) would have produced compliance. The inception (high ownership) produced commitment.

## Stripe Atlas — Dependent Stakeholder Goal Alignment

### Concept Illustrated: How connecting your initiative to a dependent stakeholder's OWN goals transforms resistance into partnership

**Context:** A Stripe PM launching Atlas (incorporation service for startups) needed support from the Legal team, which controlled compliance review processes. Legal had their own backlog and no obvious reason to prioritize Atlas work.

### The Problem: Misaligned Incentives

| Your Team | Legal Team |
|-----------|-----------|
| Goal: Launch Atlas in Q2 | Goal: Clear compliance backlog, reduce risk exposure |
| Need: Compliance review of 3 new incorporation flows | Need: Fewer rush requests from product teams |
| Timeline: 6 weeks | Timeline: 12-week backlog |

### The Naive Approach (Anti-Pattern)

Email to Legal: "We need compliance review for Atlas incorporation flows by March 15. These are high priority for our team."

**Why it failed:** Legal saw this as another team's priority imposed on their already-overloaded queue. No connection to their goals. No demonstration of homework done. No compromise offered.

### The Stakeholder-Mapped Approach

**5-Dimension Diagnostic of Legal Lead:**

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Context | Under pressure — compliance backlog growing, recent audit finding increased scrutiny |
| Goals | Reduce risk exposure, clear backlog, demonstrate proactive compliance (not just reactive review) |
| Relationship to Story | Invisible — Atlas was not on their radar |
| Relationship to PM | Neutral — limited interaction history |
| Communication Style | Written-first; wants detailed requirements before meeting |

**Goal connection strategy:** The PM reframed Atlas compliance work as *proactive* compliance — building the review into the product flow itself, which would actually reduce Legal's future burden for incorporation-related reviews.

| PM's Ask | Reframed for Legal's Goals |
|----------|--------------------------|
| "Review 3 incorporation flows" | "Co-design a compliance template that handles 80% of incorporation reviews automatically — reducing your manual review load going forward" |
| "Prioritize our work" | "Pilot an approach that could become a model for other product teams, reducing your backlog structurally" |

### The Result

Legal shifted from "this is your priority, not mine" to "this is a pilot for something we need." The Legal lead joined the project as a contributor, not just a reviewer.

**Key takeaway:** Dependent stakeholders have no inherent accountability for your success. The only way to move them is to genuinely connect your initiative to their goals — and that requires running the 5-dimension diagnostic first.

## Figma — Multi-Layer Stakeholder Map for Platform Strategy

### Concept Illustrated: How a large initiative requires different engagement methods at each organizational layer

**Context:** Figma's PM team driving the design system adoption strategy needed alignment across leadership (investment approval), their product team (execution), design tool teams (dependency), and enterprise customers (feedback).

### Layered Stakeholder Map

| Layer | Stakeholders | Type | Engagement Method | Ownership Level |
|-------|-------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Executive | CEO, VP Product, VP Engineering | Leadership | Pre-sell (Feedback → Advice) | Medium-High |
| Product leadership | Design Tools PM, Platform PM | Leadership / Contributor | Co-creation | High |
| Direct team | 8-person product team | Team | 2-day inception workshop | High |
| Adjacent teams | Editor team, FigJam team, Dev Mode team | Dependent Stakeholder | Inclusion in inception (Days 1-2) | Medium |
| Enterprise customers | 5 design system leads at large companies | External | Advisory feedback sessions | Medium |

### Sequencing Strategy

```
Week 1: Co-creation with Product leadership (build the strategy together)
Week 2: Pre-sell with Executive layer (using co-created strategy)
Week 3: Inception with Direct team + Adjacent teams (convert strategy to plan)
Week 4: Customer advisory sessions (validate approach)
Week 5: Executive ratification (everything pre-aligned)
```

### Why Layering Mattered

Each layer served a different purpose in the influence chain:
- **Product leadership co-creation** produced a strategy that leadership saw as "the team's strategy," not "one PM's idea"
- **Executive pre-sell** ensured no surprises at ratification
- **Adjacent team inclusion in inception** prevented dependency blockers from surfacing mid-execution
- **Customer feedback** added external validation that strengthened the internal story

## Anti-Pattern: The Cold Pitch That Cascaded Into Rejection

### Concept Illustrated: What happens when you skip the pre-sell and present to an unprepared group

**Context:** A PM at a Series C SaaS company had built a compelling case for a new enterprise tier. The story was solid — clear customer pain, strong market data, credible execution plan. The PM booked a 60-minute leadership review to present it.

### What Went Wrong

The PM walked into the room with 8 leaders, none of whom had seen the proposal before. Here's what happened:

| Minute | What Happened | Stakeholder Dynamic |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0-10 | PM presents Problem section with customer data | Leaders listen; VP Sales nods |
| 10-15 | PM presents Result with revenue projection | CFO raises eyebrow: "These numbers seem aggressive" |
| 15-20 | VP Engineering asks about platform implications | PM has a good answer but CFO's skepticism lingers |
| 20-30 | VP Sales voices support but VP Engineering pushes back on timeline | Leaders start debating with each other — PM loses control of the room |
| 30-45 | CFO's initial skepticism gives VP Engineering permission to escalate concerns | Group dynamic: skepticism cascades, each objection amplifies the next |
| 45-60 | Meeting ends with "let's revisit next quarter" | PM gets a polite deferral — effectively a no |

### The Diagnosis

The PM's story was strong on content (all four pillars present, three gates validated). The failure was entirely in stakeholder engagement:

- **No pre-sell** — Every leader encountered the idea for the first time in a group setting
- **No gatekeeper identification** — The PM didn't know that the CFO was the true gatekeeper (not the VP Product)
- **No stance assessment** — The CFO's skepticism about revenue projections was predictable with basic research
- **No cascade prevention** — In a group setting, one skeptic gives others permission to pile on

### The Fix

If the PM had run the stakeholder map:

| Stakeholder | What Pre-Sell Would Have Revealed | How It Changes the Outcome |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| CFO | Revenue projections need conservative + aggressive scenarios | PM presents range instead of single number — skepticism neutralized |
| VP Engineering | Needs to understand this can be phased, not all-at-once | PM includes phased architecture in the pre-read — objection addressed before the meeting |
| VP Sales | Already supportive — would have been a vocal ally | With pre-sell, VP Sales could have actively countered objections in the room |

**Key takeaway:** The pre-sell doesn't just build alignment — it prevents the cascade dynamic where group-setting skepticism compounds. When leaders have already processed and resolved their concerns privately, the meeting becomes a ratification.

## Early-Stage Startup — Lightweight Stakeholder Mapping

### Concept Illustrated: How the same frameworks scale down for small teams where "leadership" is 2 people and "dependent stakeholders" is a shared Slack channel

**Context:** A 12-person startup with 2 co-founders (CEO + CTO), 6 engineers, 2 designers, 1 PM, and 1 product marketer. The PM wants to pitch a pivot from B2C to B2B.

### Scaled-Down Landscape

| Stakeholder | Type | Pre-Sell Method | Notes |
|------------|------|-----------------|-------|
| CEO | Leadership (gatekeeper) | Co-creation | Most important — needs to own the pivot narrative for investors |
| CTO | Leadership (gatekeeper) | Co-creation | Must believe the technical architecture supports B2B |
| Full engineering team | Team | Workshop (half-day, not 5-day inception) | Small enough that everyone participates |
| Product marketer | Dependent Stakeholder | Advice | Needs to understand repositioning implications |

### What Changed vs. Enterprise Process

| Framework | Enterprise Application | Startup Application |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 5-Dimension Diagnostic | Formal assessment per stakeholder | Quick mental model — you already know everyone |
| Pre-Sell Spectrum | Multi-week sequence of 1:1s | 2 co-creation sessions over coffee this week |
| DACI | Formal document with roles assigned | Whiteboard with initials next to action items |
| Inception | 1-5 day formal workshop | Half-day team session in the conference room |
| Trust Triangle | Deliberate strategy per direction | Already happening through daily interaction |

### Key Insight

The frameworks don't change — the investment scales. A startup PM still needs to: identify who matters (gatekeepers), understand their context (5 dimensions), choose the right engagement level (ownership gradient), and adapt the story per audience. They just do it faster and more informally.

## Pattern Summary

| Case Study | Key Lesson |
|-----------|-----------|
| GoDaddy Partners (pre-sell) | Pre-selling in sequence builds momentum — each conversation strengthens the next |
| GoDaddy Pro Team (inception) | Ask the team how they want to be engaged; inception creates missionaries through participation |
| Stripe Atlas (dependent stakeholders) | Connect your initiative to their goals using their language — it's the only currency that works |
| Figma (multi-layer) | Large initiatives need layered engagement with different methods at each organizational level |
| Cold Pitch (anti-pattern) | Group-setting skepticism cascades — pre-selling prevents the compounding rejection dynamic |
| Startup (lightweight) | Same frameworks, lower investment — the principles scale down, they don't disappear |
