# Stakeholder Influence Strategy Framework

## 1. Why Stakeholder Mapping Matters

The way a PM communicates their story is a higher predictor of success than the content of the story itself. Good communication can overcome story shortcomings. Bad communication can ruin a great story. The difference between stories that get funded and stories that get politely shelved is almost always about *who* heard it, *how* they were engaged, and *whether* they felt ownership of the outcome.

**The core insight:** People naturally support ideas they believe are their own. Every framework in this document is an expression of that principle — creating graduated levels of participation that transform audiences from passive evaluators into active supporters.

## 2. Mapping Your Influence Landscape

Before adapting your story, answer: who exactly needs to hear it? This is a strategic exercise, not a box-checking one.

### Start with Needs, Work Backward to People

| What You Need | Who Controls It |
|--------------|----------------|
| Direction or strategic clarity | Senior leadership, VP/C-suite |
| Approval to proceed | Direct management chain + budget owners |
| Resources (headcount, budget) | Gatekeepers — the leaders who most directly control resourcing |
| Alignment on priorities | Cross-functional leadership |
| Dependency removed | Team leads of dependent teams |
| Advocacy / air cover | Sponsors who believe in the initiative |
| Execution | Your direct team members |

### Gatekeeper Identification

**The gatekeeper question:** "Who are the most opinionated leaders who most directly control the approval and resourcing of your story?"

This cuts through the temptation to present to everyone. Most often, gatekeepers are your direct boss and the VP of Product. But the specific answer depends on your org. Start with the org chart: your direct management chain plus leaders of dependent teams.

### Dependency Mapping (3 Steps)

For cross-functional initiatives, dependencies are where stories most often die:

1. **Define the epics** for your initiative (use inception output, roadmap, or any planning artifact)
2. **List potential dependent teams** across the organization: Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Legal, Compliance, Security, Infrastructure, other product/engineering teams
3. **Mark dependencies** — for each epic, which teams must contribute, approve, or unblock?

This surfaces hidden dependencies — the compliance team that must sign off, the infrastructure team that must provision resources — before they become execution blockers.

### DACI Framework

Formalize roles across your stakeholder landscape:

| Role | Definition | Typical Assignment |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Driver** | Accountable for the initiative's success | Product Manager (you) |
| **Approver** | Responsible for approving decisions | Product leadership, budget owners |
| **Contributors** | Direct team members doing the work | Engineers, designers, researchers |
| **Informed** | Need updates on progress | Senior leadership, dependent stakeholders |

## 3. Three Audience Types

PMs influence three fundamentally different audiences. Each operates under different incentive structures, time horizons, and relationship dynamics.

### Leadership

**What they evaluate:** Strategic alignment, customer impact, business value (size of opportunity, ROI, competitive position), feasibility (cost, timeline, resource requirements).

**Their core job:** Ensure the company deploys resources to deliver the best results. In every story, they look for proof that reward justifies investment and outweighs risk.

**What you typically need from them:** Direction, alignment, approval, support/advocacy, resources.

**Diagnostic questions:**
- Do you need leadership approval to move forward?
- Can you execute with existing resources?
- Does leadership trust your team?
- Do you have dependencies that need leadership alignment?

### Teams

**What they need:** Alignment, ideation, execution clarity, motivation, inspiration. Not just compliance — you need missionaries, not mercenaries. Teams that are motivated and inspired do significantly better work.

**Function-specific needs:**

| Function | Primary Concerns |
|----------|-----------------|
| Engineering | Technical constraints, timing, resourcing, options explored |
| Product | Customer problems, success metrics |
| Design | Customer experience, end-to-end flow |
| Research | Customer target, core questions |
| Product Marketing | Customer value, commercial potential |
| All | Impact on planning, existing roadmap, careers |

**Diagnostic questions:**
- Who will directly be doing work on this initiative?
- Who must you work with daily for this to succeed?
- What functions are necessary for completion?
- Who else shares this goal?

### Dependent Stakeholders

**What they need:** Goal alignment (connected to THEIR goals, not yours), priority clarity, timing, specific requirements, and a clear ask.

**The hard truth:** Most stakeholders won't drop everything to help your team. They have their own goals. Your job is to show how helping you helps them.

**Diagnostic questions:**
- Do you need the stakeholder's approval?
- Can you execute without their resources?
- What do you need that you don't explicitly control?

## 4. The 5-Dimension Audience Diagnostic

This model is applied identically across all three audience types. It transforms vague intuitions ("they seem skeptical") into actionable intelligence ("they are under revenue pressure, uninformed about our initiative, and prefer written pre-reads").

### The Five Dimensions

**1. Context** — What environmental pressures are they under?

| Signals to Assess | Leadership | Teams | Dependent Stakeholders |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Under pressure? | Missing quarterly numbers | Overloaded sprint, recent reorg | Tight deadlines, competing priorities |
| Exploring? | Post-funding, new strategic direction | Greenfield project, new team | Looking for allies, cross-functional wins |
| Defending? | Budget cuts, competitive threat | Layoff fears, unclear direction | Protecting their own roadmap |

**2. Goals** — What are they trying to achieve?

| Leadership Goals | Team Goals | Stakeholder Goals |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Revenue, growth | Achieving stated team goals | Their own team's metrics |
| Profitability | Promotion, recognition | Their own strategic priorities |
| Strategic differentiation | Delivering impact | Bandwidth preservation |
| Org efficiency | Culture, doing great work | Cross-functional leverage |

**3. Relationship to Story** — How aware and invested are they?

| Level | Definition | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Involved** | Has context, knows current state, participates in decisions | Minimal context-setting needed; focus on the ask |
| **Informed** | Knows about the work but hasn't been directly involved | Moderate context needed; bridge from awareness to investment |
| **Invisible** | No awareness of the team or its work | Full context required; must build from zero |

**4. Relationship to You/Your Team** — What's the trust dynamic?

Assess: Trust level, working history, existing conflicts or tensions, track record of collaboration.

**5. Communication Style** — How do they prefer to receive information?

Assess: Detail preference (executive summary vs. deep dive), format preference (presentation, written doc, conversation), engagement style (pre-read, workshop, 1:1).

### Intelligence Gathering: Watch-Research-Ask-Test

| Method | How | Best For |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Watch** | Observe in meetings — what questions do they ask? What metrics do they reference? How do they communicate? | Understanding leadership and stakeholder styles |
| **Research** | Talk to people who've worked with them. Read docs/communications they've shared. Ask your manager. | Filling gaps when you lack direct access |
| **Ask** | Directly inquire about goals, communication preferences, feedback on your team | Most accurate but requires relationship comfort |
| **Test** (teams only) | Try different approaches — workshops, written docs, collaborative reviews — and observe reactions | Iterating on team communication when uncertain |

### 5-Dimension Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | Fix |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Assuming context** | You project your own context onto the audience | Ask directly or research first |
| **One-size-fits-all** | Same story delivered identically to leadership, teams, and stakeholders | Run the 5-dimension model for each audience separately |
| **Skipping relationship assessment** | You misjudge the trust level and over- or under-invest in context-setting | Explicitly rate the relationship dimension before choosing an approach |
| **Ignoring communication style** | Written doc to a leader who hates reading; presentation to a team that wants depth | Match format to preference, not to your own comfort |

---

## 5. The Pre-Sell Spectrum

The formal pitch should be the *last* step in gaining buy-in, not the first. Many PMs treat leadership buy-in as a Shark Tank episode — one shot to impress. This is the approach least likely to succeed.

**Why:** Leaders naturally question and pressure-test ideas the first time they see them. In a group setting, this skepticism cascades — leaders undermine each other's confidence. The pre-sell gives leaders time to process, question, and develop comfort privately.

### Four Pre-Sell Methods

| Method | Intensity | What You Bring | Fidelity | Why It Works |
|--------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Co-creation** | Highest | Ideas, high-level concepts, 30-50% on paper | Low | People support ideas they believe are their own |
| **Feedback** | Moderate | 50-75% of story on paper | Medium | Invests the leader in the outcome — they see their influence reflected |
| **Advice** | Lower | 80%+ of story, higher fidelity | High | Gives context and invests them in your success — they want their advice to work |
| **Pre-read** | Lowest | 95-100% complete story | Final | Provides exposure without requiring engagement; reduces novelty-driven skepticism |

### Selection Matrix

Choose based on two factors: importance to the decision × current stance.

| | Supportive | Neutral | Opposed |
|---|-----------|---------|---------|
| **High importance (gatekeeper)** | Feedback or Advice | Feedback or Co-creation | Co-creation |
| **Medium importance** | Advice or Pre-read | Feedback or Advice | Feedback |
| **Low importance (informed only)** | Pre-read | Pre-read | Advice |

### Pre-Sell as Intelligence

The pre-sell doubles as information gathering. During each conversation you learn:
- What the leader actually cares about (may differ from official priorities)
- Objections you haven't anticipated
- Language and framing that resonates
- Political dynamics you weren't aware of

Use this intelligence to strengthen your story before the formal ask.

## 6. The Ownership Gradient

The most powerful principle in stakeholder influence: ownership flows from participation, and participation exists on a gradient.

```
Co-creation → Feedback → Advice → Pre-read → Cold pitch
   (high)                                        (low)
  OWNERSHIP                                     OWNERSHIP
```

This gradient applies across all audience types:

| Audience | High Ownership | Low Ownership |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Leadership | Co-created the strategy | Received a pre-read the night before |
| Teams | Ran an inception workshop to plan the work | Received a briefing on what to build |
| Stakeholders | Participated in dependency mapping and planning | Received a list of requirements |

**The rule:** Aim for the highest ownership level that time and relationship allow. Every step higher on the gradient increases the probability of committed support.

### When to Accept Lower Ownership

- Time is genuinely constrained (e.g., board meeting in 3 days)
- The stakeholder is low-importance and only needs to be informed
- The relationship is already high-trust and established
- The decision is low-stakes and reversible

---

## 7. The Trust Triangle

Trust operates differently across the three audience types, requiring three distinct trust-building strategies.

### Upward Trust (Leadership)

**Built through: Competence**

| Trust Builder | What It Looks Like |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Facts not opinions | Evidence-based arguments; data and research, not "I think" |
| Preparation | Content and talking points ready for deep questions |
| Conviction | Passion and confidence — leadership reacts to your belief level |
| Follow-through | Delivering what you promised from previous interactions |

### Lateral Trust (Teams)

**Built through: Authenticity**

| Trust Builder | What It Looks Like |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Transparency about impact | Honest about what changes for the team — what gets deprioritized |
| Genuine passion | Real excitement about the mission, not performative enthusiasm |
| Willingness to listen | Workshop and co-create, don't just present |
| Recognition | Acknowledge the team's contributions and expertise |

### Outward Trust (Dependent Stakeholders)

**Built through: Reciprocity**

| Trust Builder | What It Looks Like |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Empathy for constraints | Understanding their bandwidth, timeline, and competing priorities |
| Goal connection | Showing how your initiative helps THEM reach their goals |
| Homework done | Clear, specific ask that shows you've minimized the burden |
| Willingness to compromise | Ready to negotiate scope, timing, and priority |

### Trust Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Audience | Consequence |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Leading with opinion, not data | Leadership | Erodes credibility; next story starts with a deficit |
| Concealing impact on roadmap | Teams | Team discovers deprioritization mid-sprint; trust collapses |
| Sending a requirements doc with no context | Stakeholders | Stakeholder feels used; passive resistance follows |
| Making commitments you can't keep | All | Short-term win, long-term trust bankruptcy |

---

## 8. Content Adaptation by Audience

The same PRAA story needs different emphasis for different audiences.

### What Each Audience Needs to Hear

| Element | Leadership | Teams | Dependent Stakeholders |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| **The Ask** | Resources, approval, strategic direction | Role-specific asks; what changes for each person | Alignment, milestones, deliverables |
| **Strategic connection** | Deep — this is their primary lens | Light — cover quickly, don't belabor | Reframed to connect to THEIR strategy |
| **Customer impact** | Is the problem real and big enough? | Why this matters to the user (mission fuel) | Relevant only if it connects to their goals |
| **Business value** | Size of opportunity, ROI, competitive position | How it impacts team success and recognition | Win-win framing for both teams |
| **Execution details** | Minimal — they trust you on the how | Deep — timeline, constraints, what's unknown | Specific — exactly what you need from them and when |
| **Impact on existing work** | Not relevant | Critical — what gets deprioritized? | Critical — how does this affect their plans? |

### Updating the Ask per Audience

| Audience | Ask Characteristics | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Leadership | Quantified, strategic-level | "3 engineers + $150K for 6 months to capture a $5M ARR opportunity" |
| Teams | Role-specific, execution-level | "Engineering: API integration by Sprint 4. Design: User testing complete by Week 3" |
| Stakeholders | Dependency-focused, timeline-specific | "We need your team to review and approve the security assessment by March 15" |

---

## 9. Communication Across the Lifecycle

Stakeholder engagement is not a one-time event — it evolves as the initiative progresses.

| Phase | Leadership Communication | Team Communication | Stakeholder Communication |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Discovery** | Pre-sell conversations; build alignment on the opportunity | Workshop to co-explore the problem space | Early identification of dependencies |
| **Planning** | Formal pitch for approval; use pre-sold alignment | Inception workshop to convert story into execution plan | Include in inception for execution alignment |
| **Execution** | Lightweight status updates via established cadences | Sprint reviews, standups, ongoing alignment | Dependency tracking, milestone check-ins |
| **Iteration** | Impact report connecting results to the original story | Retrospective + next-cycle planning | Share results, thank contributors, build trust for next time |

### 5-Dimension Diagnostic Cheat Sheet

| Dimension | Key Question |
|-----------|-------------|
| Context | What pressures are they under right now? |

| Communication style | How do they prefer to receive information? |

### Pre-Sell Quick-Select

| If the stakeholder is... | Use... |
|--------------------------|--------|
| High importance + opposed | Co-creation |
| High importance + neutral | Feedback |
| Medium importance + any stance | Advice |
| Low importance + any stance | Pre-read |

### Trust Triangle Cheat Sheet

| Direction | Currency | Built By |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Upward (leadership) | Competence | Data, preparation, conviction |
| Lateral (teams) | Authenticity | Transparency, passion, listening |
| Outward (stakeholders) | Reciprocity | Empathy, goal connection, compromise |

### Ownership Gradient Rule

More participation → more ownership → more support. Aim for the highest level that time and relationship allow.
