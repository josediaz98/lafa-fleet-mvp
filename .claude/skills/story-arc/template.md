> [Date] | [Author] | Archetype: [Strategy / Process / Adoption / Budget]

## Three-Gate Validation

| Gate | Question | Assessment | Evidence |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| **1. Interest** | Does this serve both customer and business? | [Pass / Fail / Partial] | [How it helps the customer from THEIR perspective + how it creates a business opportunity] |
| **2. Alignment** | Does this fit company strategy and goals? | [Pass / Fail / Partial] | [Specific strategy, OKR, or leadership priority this connects to] |
| **3. Feasibility** | Can this actually be done? | [Pass / Fail / Partial] | [Gut-check plausibility + brand fit + technical possibility] |

**Validation verdict:** [Proceed / Reshape / Defer — if any gate fails, note what needs to change before proceeding]

## Context Assessment

Rate each dimension on a 1-5 scale and note the implication for your story:

| Dimension | Current State (1-5) | Assessment | Story Implication |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Business Success** | [1=Missing budget ... 5=Exceeding] | [Brief description of how the business is performing] | [How this shapes your framing — e.g., "Lead with ROI timeline" or "Can pitch longer-term bets"] |
| **Business Lifecycle** | [1=Early stage ... 5=Late stage] | [Where the company is in its lifecycle] | [What story types the lifecycle favors] |
| **Market Situation** | [1=High competition ... 5=Low competition] | [Competitive landscape assessment] | [Whether to emphasize differentiation vs. catching up] |
| **Financial Situation** | [1=Low on cash ... 5=Rolling in cash] | [Cash position and spending appetite] | [Whether to break into milestones or pitch holistically] |
| **Team Situation** | [1=Low trust ... 5=High trust] | [Trust level between your team and leadership] | [Whether to start with quick wins or go big] |

**Timing verdict:** [Favorable / Reshape to fit / Wait for better moment]

## PRAA Story Arc

### Problem

**Customer Problem / Current State:**

[2-3 paragraphs. Paint the problem vividly through the eyes of your main character. Ground it in specific scenarios, data, or anecdotes. The reader should FEEL the pain, not just understand it intellectually.]

[Include: Who is affected? How often? What's the magnitude? What do they do today as a workaround?]

**Business Problem / Current State:**

[1-2 paragraphs. What is the company losing or missing because of this problem? Frame as an opportunity cost or strategic gap, not just an internal complaint.]

[Include: Revenue impact, competitive exposure, strategic misalignment, or operational cost]

---

### Result

**Customer Result / Desired End State:**

[1-2 paragraphs. Describe concretely what the customer's experience looks like AFTER the problem is solved. Use sensory, specific language — not "improved efficiency" but observable changes.]

[Include: What disappears from their life? What new capabilities do they have? What does their day look like?]

**Business Result / Desired End State:**

[1-2 paragraphs. Connect the customer result to business outcomes. Explicitly tie to company strategy and goals.]

[Include: Expected metric impact, strategic positioning, competitive advantage, or cost reduction]

---

### Action

[2-3 paragraphs. How you get from current state to desired state. Include phasing, key milestones, architecture decisions, and partnerships. Should feel achievable — not magical.]

**Phasing:**

| Phase | Timeline | What Gets Built/Changed | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Timeframe] | [Scope] | [Measurable outcome] |
| 2 | [Timeframe] | [Scope] | [Measurable outcome] |
| 3 | [Timeframe] | [Scope] | [Measurable outcome] |

**Key dependencies:** [What must be true or in place for this to work]

**What we are NOT doing:** [Explicit exclusions that prevent scope creep and demonstrate strategic thinking]

---

### Ask

[Be specific. Quantify where possible. State what happens next if the answer is yes.]

**What we need:**
- [Resource ask #1 — e.g., "2 engineers for 8 weeks starting Q2"]
- [Resource ask #2 — e.g., "Design review capacity: 4 hours/week for 6 weeks"]
- [Decision ask — e.g., "Approval to deprioritize X in favor of this initiative"]

**What we're committing to in return:**
- [Milestone #1 by date]
- [Milestone #2 by date]
- [Success metric we'll report on]

## Content Pillar Audit

For each pillar, identify at least one content element included in your story:

| Pillar | Content Element | Where It Appears in PRAA | Status |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|--------|
| **Tangible** | [Prototype, mockup, workflow diagram, before/after visual, or video — something that makes the result VISIBLE] | [Problem / Result / Action / Ask] | [Ready / In Progress / Needed] |
| **Emotional** | [Customer quote, journey map, pain point anecdote, or user research finding — something that makes the audience FEEL] | [Problem / Result / Action / Ask] | [Ready / In Progress / Needed] |
| **Clear** | [Strategy connection, familiar framing, quantified ask, or stated assumptions — something that makes it UNDERSTANDABLE] | [Problem / Result / Action / Ask] | [Ready / In Progress / Needed] |
| **Believable** | [Market research, experiment results, analytics, financial model, competitive proof, or technical architecture — something that makes it TRUSTWORTHY] | [Problem / Result / Action / Ask] | [Ready / In Progress / Needed] |

**Gaps to address:** [List any pillar that is missing or weak, and what you plan to do about it]

---

## Elevator Pitch (30-Second Version)

[Compress the full PRAA into 3-4 sentences. This becomes your safety net for reactive storytelling moments — hallway conversations, surprise meetings, leadership drop-ins.]

**Problem:** [One sentence — the vivid, felt problem]

**Result:** [One sentence — the compelling destination]

**Action:** [One sentence — the credible path]

**Ask:** [One sentence — the specific request]
