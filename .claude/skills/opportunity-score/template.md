|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Strategic Fit | [X]/3 | [One-line assessment] |
| User Value | [X]/3 | [One-line assessment] |
| Business Value | [X]/3 | [One-line assessment] |
| **Total** | **[X]/9** | **[Go / Conditional Go / No-Go / Needs Research]** |

## Strategic Fit ([Score]/3)

**Strategy Ladder:**
- **Mission:** [How this connects to company mission/vision]
- **Company Strategy:** [How this advances company strategy]
- **Product Strategy:** [Which of the 6 strategic dimensions this strengthens]
- **Team Goals:** [How this serves current team OKRs]

**Assessment:** [Detailed explanation of strategic alignment. Does it ladder clearly through all 4 levels? Which strategic dimension does it advance?]

### Strategic Fit Rubric Reference

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Ladders clearly to all 4 levels; directly advances a strategic dimension |
| **2 - Moderate** | Connects to strategy but indirectly; supports rather than drives |
| **1 - Weak** | Tenuous connection; could be justified post-hoc but wasn't strategy-driven |
| **0 - None** | Doesn't connect to strategy; opportunistic or reactive |

## User Value ([Score]/3)

**Problem Severity:** [Low / Medium / High] - [Frequency and impact description]

**Current Alternatives:** [What users do today + how effective those alternatives are + switching cost]

**Demand Signals:** [Evidence: support tickets, NPS comments, interview findings, behavioral evidence like workarounds, drop-offs, cancellations]

**Customer Lens Filters:**
- [ ] **Not vocal minority** - [Does the majority experience this problem?]
- [ ] **Target user verified** - [Are requesters in the target audience?]
- [ ] **Optimal solution** - [Are users requesting the best solution, or just top-of-mind?]

**Assessment:** [Detailed explanation of user value. How painful is the problem? How poor are alternatives? How strong are demand signals?]

### User Value Rubric Reference

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Strong** | High severity, poor alternatives, strong demand signals from target users |
| **2 - Moderate** | Medium severity, some alternatives exist, moderate demand |
| **1 - Weak** | Low severity, good alternatives exist, demand from non-target or vocal minority |
| **0 - None** | No evidence of user problem; solution looking for a problem |

## Business Value ([Score]/3)

**Funnel Impact:** [Where in the funnel: acquisition / activation / retention / monetization / referral] - [Magnitude: % users affected x severity of improvement]

**Revenue/Cost Impact:**
- Direct revenue: [New revenue, expansion, reduced churn]
- Cost savings: [Reduced support, operational efficiency]
- Indirect value: [Data generated, platform extensibility]

**Measurability:** [Can we measure success? Do we have instrumentation? Timeline to see results?]

**Proxy Metrics Used:** [If applicable: internal proxies from similar features, external proxies from comparable companies. State assumptions explicitly.]

**Assessment:** [Detailed explanation of business value. How large is the funnel impact? How clear is the revenue path? How measurable is success?]

### Business Value Rubric Reference

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Strong** | Large funnel impact, clear revenue path, easily measurable |
| **2 - Moderate** | Moderate impact, indirect revenue, measurable with effort |
| **1 - Weak** | Small impact, speculative revenue, hard to measure |
| **0 - None** | No clear business case; "nice to have" with no metrics path |

## Classification

**4D Lens(es):** [Strategy / Vision / Customer / Business]
**Multi-lens?** [Yes/No -- which lenses and why?]

**Company Stage:** [Pre-PMF / Post-PMF Scaling / Post-PMF Maturity]
**Recommended Lenses for Stage:** [Per stage weighting table]
**Alignment:** [Does this opportunity's lens mix match the company stage?]

## Recommended Action

[Specific recommendation based on scores + certainty + classification]

### If Go:
- **Priority:** [P0 / P1 / P2]
- **Next step:** [Specific action -- design sprint, PRD, build sprint, etc.]
- **Timeline:** [Rough estimate]
- **Dependencies:** [What must happen first]
- **Success metrics:** [What we'll measure and target values]

### If Needs Research:
- **Key unknowns:** [List specific unknowns]
- **Research plan:** [Interviews, data analysis, prototypes, competitive research]
- **Decision deadline:** [When to revisit with findings]

### If No-Go:
- **Reason:** [Which component failed and why]
- **Conditions to reconsider:** [What would need to change to make this viable]
