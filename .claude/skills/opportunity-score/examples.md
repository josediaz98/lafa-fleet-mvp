# Opportunity Scoring: Case Studies & Examples

Real-world examples demonstrating how the three-component model and 4D lens framework play out in practice. All examples use real companies and real outcomes.

## Success: Google Photos (All Three Components Aligned)

**Context:** Google evaluating whether to build a standalone photos product.

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Strategic Fit** | 3/3 | Integrated with Google Drive ecosystem; advanced Google's AI/ML capabilities |
| **User Value** | 3/3 | AI-powered photo organization was genuinely differentiated; solved real pain of photo management at scale |
| **Business Value** | 3/3 | Storage upsells (Google One), photo print services, data for ML training |
| **Total** | **9/9** | |

**Outcome:** 5 billion+ downloads, 4.7-star rating.

**Lesson:** When all three components are strong, the opportunity compounds. Strategic fit created the technical foundation (AI/ML), user value drove adoption (genuinely better experience), and business value sustained investment (storage monetization).

## Failure: Amazon Fire Phone (Missing User Value)

**Context:** Amazon entering the smartphone market in 2014.

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Strategic Fit** | 3/3 | Leveraged Amazon's language processing technology; extended e-commerce ecosystem to mobile hardware |
| **User Value** | 0/3 | Inferior UX compared to iPhone/Android; limited app store; gimmicky features (Dynamic Perspective 3D) that didn't solve real problems |
| **Business Value** | 3/3 | Deep e-commerce integration; Firefly feature could identify and sell products; locked users into Amazon ecosystem |
| **Total** | **6/9 (with a 0)** | |

**Outcome:** Discontinued after 1 year. Amazon took a $170M write-down.

**Lesson:** Strategic fit + business value without user value = failure. Leadership typically pre-validates strategic fit and business value, but user problems require direct validation through research. No amount of strategic alignment or business potential compensates for a product users don't want.

## Success: Lyft Destination Mode (Full Validation Journey)

**Context:** Lyft's Driver Experience team evaluating the end-of-session experience for part-time suburban drivers.

### Step 1: Manager Briefing

| Element | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| **Strategic Fit** | Ladders to mission ("improve lives with best transportation") > strategy (flexible earning for drivers) > product strategy (driver value from Lyft app) > team goal (better driver experience) |
| **User** | Part-time drivers in suburban/rural areas who commute to busier areas |
| **Problem hypothesis** | Struggling to find rides going toward their destination at end of driving session |
| **Signal** | High cancellation rates for end-of-session rides |
| **Scale** | 75% of driver population potentially affected |

### Step 2: User Value Validation (Interviews)

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Severity** | High -- frustrating for passengers (cancellations), costly for drivers (wasted time and gas) |
| **Alternatives** | Turn off app and drive home earning nothing, OR keep canceling until finding a ride going the right direction |
| **Both alternatives are bad** | First = lost earnings; second = poor passenger experience and potential deactivation |

### Step 3: Business Value (Funnel Analysis)

Built a feature funnel: Start session > Receive request > Accept > View destination > Pick up > Complete

| Step | Finding |
|------|---------|
| Steps 1-2 | Biggest drop-offs, but driven by supply/demand (outside team scope) |
| **Step 4** | 4% drop-off after viewing destination -- unexpected for that point in journey |
| **Proxy metric** | "View destination before pickup" feature had caused a 3% increase in cancellations |
| **Estimate** | Most of that 3% came from commuting drivers at end of session |
| **Conservative projection** | New feature could reduce cancellations by 1.5% (half of proxy) |

### Scores

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Strategic Fit | 3/3 | Clear ladder through all 4 levels |
| User Value | 3/3 | High severity, poor alternatives, 75% of driver base |
| Business Value | 3/3 | Quantified 1.5% cancellation reduction via proxy; clear funnel impact |
| **Total** | **9/9** | |

**Outcome:** Destination Mode became one of Lyft's most impactful differentiating features.

**Lessons:**
- Unexpected drop-offs (not just the biggest ones) often reveal the best opportunities
- Internal proxies from related features provide reasonable estimates
- Conservative estimates (50% of proxy) account for edge cases and unknowns

## RICE-Killer: Patreon Pricing Overhaul (Framework Failure Case)

**Context:** 2019, Patreon considering restructuring pricing from flat 5% to tiered 5%/8%/12%.

### How Traditional Frameworks Would Score It

| RICE Factor | Assessment | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Reach** | All creators (high) | Positive |
| **Impact** | Uncertain (massive if works, disaster if fails) | Mixed |
| **Confidence** | Low (unquantified, no proxy for total restructure) | Negative |
| **Effort** | Very high (complete product repackaging + new features for each tier) | Very negative |
| **RICE Score** | Low | **Would be deprioritized** |

### Actual Outcome

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Margins | **Doubled** |
| Acquisition impact | None (no decrease) |
| Retention impact | None (no increase in churn) |

**Lesson:** This was a needle-moving win that RICE would have killed. The RICE formula systematically penalizes high-effort, lower-confidence work -- exactly the kind of work that produces step-change outcomes. The 4D framework would have surfaced this via the Strategy lens (monetization dimension) and Business lens (direct revenue impact), ensuring it got proper consideration despite the uncertainty.

## Over-Indexing on Strategy: Evernote

**What happened:**

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Early success | 10 million users, profitable in 3 years |
| Strategy push | Launched Peek (iPad cover), Hello (business cards), Food (recipes) -- all aligned to "capture everything" strategy |
| What they ignored | Customer complaints about buggy core product |
| Result | Viral complaints, high churn, became cash-flow negative by 2016 |

**Over-indexing signal present:** Steady, unanticipated metric decline (retention dropping because user feedback was deprioritized in favor of strategic expansion).

**Lesson:** Strategy lens must be balanced with Customer and Business lenses. Users don't care about your strategic dimensions if the core product is broken. Evernote's new apps all had strategic fit, but the team ignored the Customer lens signals telling them to fix what they had first.

---

## Over-Indexing on Vision: Lambda School

**What happened:**

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Core vision | Revolutionize education via income-share agreements (ISAs) |
| Expansion | New fields (UX design), new geographies (Africa, UK, EU) |
| Problem | Still figuring out a sustainable model for core US coding programs |
| Result | Quality complaints, job placement lawsuits, consecutive layoffs (2020, 2021) |

**Over-indexing signal present:** Significant investment in new initiatives despite core product having significant room to improve.

**Lesson:** Vision lens expansion before core is solid creates existential risk. Lambda School's vision was compelling, but expanding before proving the model in one market meant spreading resources across many fronts while none were working well.

## Over-Indexing on Customer: HubSpot's UserVoice Trap

**What happened:**

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Approach | Build whatever was most highly upvoted on UserVoice (customer feedback tool) |
| Initial result | Good returns -- easy wins, users happy |
| Later result | Diminishing returns; eventually working on profile photos (negligible impact) |

**Over-indexing signals present:**
1. Steady decline in impact of product work (easy wins depleted)
2. Bloated product with low-adoption features

**Lesson:** The Customer lens depletes over time. Users request what they can imagine, not what would differentiate the product. As Thomas Tunguz (Redpoint Ventures) notes: "Customers rarely push vendors to further their differentiation. By definition, the unique selling proposition doesn't exist elsewhere in the market."

### Related: Patreon Power User Trap

| Situation | Large creators threatened to leave unless specific features built |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Built | Team Accounts feature |
| Result | Extremely low adoption, significant technical overhead, accumulated tech debt |

**Lesson:** Vocal minority (power users) can hijack the roadmap. The three customer lens filters would have caught this -- the feature served a non-representative minority, not the broader creator base.

---

## Over-Indexing on Business: Farmville (Zynga) & LinkedIn Endorsements

### Farmville

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Launch | Major hit, mass market appeal |
| Focus | Monetization metrics (social shares, virtual item purchases) |
| Ignored | No investment in keeping game updated for evolving tastes |
| Result | Lost user base entirely; game shut down |

### LinkedIn Endorsements

| Phase | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Intent | Enable finding experts with specific skills |
| Execution | Optimized for engagement; allowed anyone to endorse anyone for anything |
| Short-term | Boosted engagement metrics significantly |
| Long-term | Erased all value (couldn't filter for actual experts); feature became meaningless |

**Over-indexing signals present:**
1. No significant product functionality improvements
2. Features that improve metrics short-term but quickly decline (no underlying value)

**Lesson:** Business lens initiatives that don't create real user value are sugar highs -- metrics spike then decay. LinkedIn Endorsements moved the engagement KPI but destroyed the feature's utility. Both cases show what happens when you optimize the metric instead of the experience.

## Multi-Lens Beats Single-Lens: Notejoy Zoom Integration

**Context:** Sachin Rekhi's Notejoy (collaborative note-taking) choosing between two objectives for the quarter.

| Option | Lenses Served | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Zoom integration** | Customer (users requested it) + Strategy (meeting notes naturally collaborative, accelerates viral acquisition loop) | **Prioritized** |
| SEO signup quality | Strategy only (improve acquisition channel) | Deprioritized |

**Decision rationale:** Both options served the Strategy lens. But Zoom integration also served the Customer lens (users had explicitly asked for it). The multi-lens objective was prioritized because it achieved two goals simultaneously.

**Lesson:** When comparing objectives, multi-lens opportunities create more leverage. This is Principle 1 of objective-level prioritization: prioritize objectives that fall under multiple lenses.

## Proxy Metric Application: Lyft Destination Mode (Detailed)

This example shows how to estimate business value when the feature doesn't exist yet:

### Building the Proxy

| Step | Action | Data |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Identify the problem in funnel | 4% cancellation rate at Step 4 (after viewing destination) |
| 2 | Find an internal proxy | "View destination before pickup" feature caused 3% increase in cancellations |
| 3 | Hypothesize the connection | Most of that 3% came from commuting drivers at end of session |
| 4 | Apply conservatively | Estimate new feature could reduce cancellations by 1.5% (half of proxy) |

### Why 50% of Proxy

- Not all cancellations at Step 4 are from the target user segment
- Some drivers may not use the feature even if available
- Edge cases and adoption curve reduce initial impact
- Conservative estimate builds credibility with stakeholders

### Result

The actual outcome exceeded the conservative estimate -- Destination Mode became one of Lyft's most impactful features, suggesting the proxy was directionally correct but the real impact was even larger.

## Quick Reference: Pattern Recognition

### "This opportunity has strategic fit and business value but weak user value"
**Pattern:** Amazon Fire Phone. Red flag. Do not proceed without validating user value through direct research.

### "RICE scores this low but my gut says it's important"
**Pattern:** Patreon Pricing Overhaul. RICE penalizes needle-moving work. Check if the Strategy or Vision lens supports it.

### "Users are loudly requesting this feature"
**Pattern:** Apply the three customer lens filters before acting. Could be HubSpot's UserVoice trap (diminishing returns), Patreon's power user trap (vocal minority), or ProductBoard's suboptimal solutioning (users requesting wrong solution to right problem).

### "This moves our metrics but doesn't change the product much"
**Pattern:** Farmville / LinkedIn Endorsements. Business lens over-index. Check if it creates lasting user value or just a metric sugar high.

### "We're launching new products while the core is buggy"
**Pattern:** Evernote. Strategy lens over-index. Rebalance toward Customer lens.

### "We're expanding to new markets before the first market works"
**Pattern:** Lambda School. Vision lens over-index. Prove the core before scaling.

### "I can't decide between two good options"
**Pattern:** Notejoy Zoom vs. SEO. Count the lenses. Multi-lens wins.
